Are there sufficient figures and examples to illustrate the key points? Is the paper accessible to those outside the application domain? Is it accessible to those in other technical specialties?</p><p><i>Task or Problem Description:</i> Describe the task the application performs or the problem it solves. State the objectives of the application and explain why an AI solution was important. If other solutions were tried and failed outline these solutions and the reasons for their failure.</p><p><i>Application Description:</i> Describe the application, providing key technical details about design and implementation. What are the system components, what are their functions, and how do they interact? What languages and tools are used in the application? How is knowledge represented? What is the hardware and software environment in which the system is deployed? Provide examples to illustrate how the system is used.</p><p><i>Uses of AI Technology:</i> On what AI research results does the application depend? What key aspects of AI technology allowed the application to succeed? How were the techniques modified to fit the needs of the application? If applicable, describe how AI technology is integrated with other technology. If a commercial tool is used, explain the decision criteria used to select it. Describe any insights gained about the application of AI technology. What AI approaches or techniques were tried and did not work? Why not?</p><p><i>Application Use and Payoff:</i> How long has this application been deployed? Explain how widely, how often, and by whom the application is being used. Also describe the application's payoff. What measurable benefits have resulted from its use? What additional benefits do you expect over time? What impacts has it had on the users' business processes?</p><p><i>Application Development and Deployment:</i> Describe the development and deployment process. How long did they take? How many developers were involved? What were the costs? What were the difficulties, and how were they overcome? What are the lessons learned? What, if any, formal development methods were used?</p><p><i>Maintenance:</i> Describe your experience with and plans for maintenance of the application. Who maintains the application? How often is update needed? Is domain knowledge expected to change over time? How does the design of the application facilitate update?</p><p><i>Other Comments:</i></p><div class="hr1"><hr /></div><h3 class="text1"><a name="emerging">Emerging Technology Paper Review Form</a></h3><p>We suggest the following format: (1) Summarize the content of the article; (2) Discuss its contribution; (3) Discuss its flaws; (4) Provide suggestions for improvement.</p><p><i>Significance:</i> How important is the problem being addressed?
