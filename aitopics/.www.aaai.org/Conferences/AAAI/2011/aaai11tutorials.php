Machine Learning in Time Series Databases (and Everything Is a Time Series!)</h4>
<p><b>Eamonn Keogh</b></p>

<p>Time series and multimedia data are ubiquitous; large volumes of such data are routinely created in scientific, industrial, entertainment, medical and biological domains. Examples include gene expression data, medical imagery, electrocardiograms, electroencephalograms, gait analysis, stock market quotes, space telemetry, microarrays, zoology, and others. Furthermore, many kinds of data that are not true time series can be fruitfully transformed into pseudo-time series, including text, DNA, shapes, video, and others.</p>

<p>To deal with such data we must carefully chose algorithms and data representations. While most representations used in the past have been real valued (wavelets and Fourier methods) in this tutorial I advocate for using discrete (symbolic) representations of the data. Symbolic representations allow us to use very useful algorithms and data structures which are not available for real data, for example suffix trees, hashing and Markov models.</p>

<p>The tutorial will be illustrated with numerous real world examples created just for this tutorial, including examples from archeology (petroglyphs and projectile points), microscopy (nematodes and blood cells), historical manuscripts, zoology, motion capture and biometrics. The data mining tasks considered include indexing, classification, clustering, novelty discovery, motif discovery and visualization.</p>

Security Games</h4>
<p><b>Chris Kiekintveld, Nicola Gatti, and Manish Jain</b></p>

<p>Game theory is an increasingly important paradigm for modeling and decision-making in security domains, including homeland security resource allocation decisions, robot patrolling strategies, and computer network security. Several deployed real-world systems use game theory to randomize critical security decisions to prevent terrorist adversaries from exploiting a predictable security schedule. The ARMOR system deployed at the LAX airport and the IRIS system deployed by the Federal Air Marshals Service were first presented at the AAMAS conference.</p>

<p>This tutorial will introduce a wide variety of game-theoretic modeling techniques and algorithms that have been developed in recent years for security problems. Introductory material on game theory and mathematical programming (optimization) will be included in the tutorial, so there is no prerequisite knowledge for participants. After introducing the basic security game framework, we will describe algorithms for scaling to very large games, methods for modeling uncertainty and attacker observation capabilities in security games, and applications of these techniques for randomized resource allocation and patrolling problems. At the end we will highlight the many opportunities for future work in this area, including exciting new domains and fundamental theoretical and algorithmic challenges.

Discourse Structure: Theory and Practice</h4>
<p><b>Bonnie Webber, Markus Egg, and Valia Kordoni</b></p>

<p>Understanding natural language is a long-standing goal of AI. Since language is more than just individual sentences, achieving this goal means confronting discourse and its structure. But doing so can also improve system performance on tasks such as information extraction, summarization, essay grading, and opinion mining.</p>

<p>This tutorial presents aspects of discourse structure and the improvements they can bring to system performance. The tutorial eschews a monolithic view of discourse structure in favor of an integrated approach to topic modeling and segmentation, genre-specific discourse segmentation, entity-based structure, structure based on discourse relations, and hierarchical structure.</p>

<p>Part 1 of the tutorial presents complementary bases for organizing and structuring discourse and their formal properties, to demonstrate the challenges of discourse modeling. Since an integrated, multifaceted approach to discourse structure can use different algorithms to recognize different structures, Part 2 describes algorithms in current use and resources for their training and/or evaluation. The possibility of joint modeling, addressing multiple aspects of discourse structure simultaneously, will emerge as a possible way forward. Part 3 outlines established and novel uses of discourse structure in the tasks noted above. We close with a list of problems for attempts to use discourse structure more widely or, more significantly, to achieve AI's Holy Grail of understanding natural language.</p>

Trust Theory: A Socio-Cognitive and Computational Model</h4>
<p><b>Cristiano Castelfranchi and Rino Falcone</b></p>

<p>In this tutorial we will define and analyze the socio-cognitive approach to trust, also comparing it with the different other approaches developed in the last 10 years in the AI domain and in particular in the field of multiAgent Systems. The relevance of the research on trust is strongly influenced by the increasing quality and variety of the work and realization of the autonomy concept in artificial agents (particularly supported by evolving programming languages and development tools for multiagent systems implementation). Increasing agents, autonomy, trust becomes a fundamental mediator of the social action that is the essential nucleus of the new societies.</p>

<p>A particular attention will be placed on the notion of trust and of its role in the human and artificial social intelligence. Then we will analyze the quantitative aspects of trust, its dynamics, the relationships with control, and autonomy. Special emphasis will be also placed on the relationships with the economic approach to trust, and on the new developments deriving from the introduction of trust relationship in the classical dependence networks.</p>

<p>The tutorial is intended as an introduction to the field: The target audience includes researchers in AI, but also in social, philosophical, and economical disciplines interested to a theoretical analysis of trust. It could be also of interest for both PhD students and expert practitioners (both from academia/industry, or working in other areas of AI research) who are interested in learning more about the socio-cognitive foundations of the AI.</p>

Event Processing &mdash; State of the Art and Research Challenges</h4>
<p><b>Opher Etzion and Yagil Engel</b></p>

<p>The term <i>event processing</i> refers to an approach to software systems that is based on reaction to events, often under time constraints, and that includes specific decision making logic based on detection of patterns in events as they occur. In comparison to traditional AI methods, event processing avoids comprehensive decision theoretic analysis in favor of tractability and quick reaction given high volumes of real-time data. Event processing is being used for dynamic operational behavior (for example, real-time algorithmic trading in capital markets), active diagnostics (for example, problem determination in network management), information dissemination (for example, detecting patterns of signals from multiple monitors connected to a patient), and observation (for example, a luggage arrived at a cart destined to the wrong flight).
 
The tutorial is intended for the AI community; it is self-contained and does not require any prior knowledge. The audience will gain insights about event processing, and on how it relates to various AI subdisciplines. The first part of the talk will detail the current state of the art, the leading architectures, the basic building blocks, and the various programming styles; the second part will be dedicated to research challenges in temporal probabilistic reasoning, semantic correctness, pattern matching, inexact processing, and machine learning.</p>

Human Computation: Core Research Questions and State of the Art</h4>
<p><b>Luis von Ahn and Edith Law</b></p>

<p>Human computation is the study of systems where humans perform a major part of the computation or are an integral part of the overall computational system. With the growth of the web, human computation systems, for example, Games With A Purpose (the ESP Game), crowdsourcing marketplaces (Amazon Mechanical Turk, oDesk), and identity verification tasks (reCaptcha), can now leverage the abilities of an unprecedented number of people to solve complex problems that are beyond the scope of existing AI algorithms.</p>

<p>Our tutorial will highlight the core research questions in human computation, and focus on the design of mechanisms, algorithms and interfaces for tackling each of those questions. The tutorial will be divided into two sections: (1) human computation algorithms (for example, programming paradigms and tools, efficiency, output aggregation, task routing, the role of machine intelligence), and (2) design (for example, games with a purpose, incentives, human computation markets, crowd-driven interfaces). We expect participants to leave with a bird's eye view of the research landscape, as well as some tools to begin their own investigations.

Recognizing Behavior in a Spatio-Temporal Context</h4>
<p><b>Hans W. Guesgen, Mehul Bhatt, and Stephen Marsland</b></p>

<p>Recognizing human behavior plays a significant role in many applications, ranging from ensuring security in public and private places to monitoring people (for example, with diminished or challenged mental and physical capabilities) and their interactions with systems and artefacts in a smart home, to name just two examples. Recent years have seen significant progress in methods, algorithms, and technologies for behavior recognition, but the task remains to be a challenging one and far from being solved.</p>

<p>The tutorial will provide an introduction to the recent developments of the area of behavior recognition, highlighting the AI techniques that are most frequently used to achieve the task. It will argue that behavior recognition in isolation is likely to fail, independently of which method is used. Based on this observation, it will demonstrate how considering the spatio-temporal context in which the behavior occurs can boost the performance of the recognition process. The tutorial concludes by highlighting some challenges and opportunities for AI research in this vibrant and emerging area of sociological, scientific, and economic interest. Since the topic integrates many areas of AI, it is appropriate to a general audience.</p>

Collective Intelligence</h4>
<p><b>Haym Hirsh</b></p>

<p>Collective intelligence refers to our ability to bring people and computing together in ways that exhibit behaviors and achieve outcomes that, collectively, are more intelligent than is possible by people or machines alone. Collective intelligence makes contact with AI in three ways. First, AI practitioners are increasingly using collective intelligence as a routine element in their work, such as to create corpora in computer vision or to evaluate results in information retrieval. Second, AI methods are a key enabler of many examples of collective intelligence, such as mining consumer behaviors and product review sentiments to facilitate product recommendation. Third, collective intelligence offers a provocative phenomenon to consider by those seeking computationally tractable understandings of intelligence. This tutorial will survey the state of the art in collective intelligence from an AI perspective. It will discuss examples of collective intelligence in which people knowingly act to achieve collective outcomes, such as editing Wikipedia articles, identifying astronomical objects, or rating news articles, as well as examples in which collectively intelligent outcomes arise through automated analysis of people's routine activities, as exhibited by Google's page ranking algorithm and Amazon's recommendation system. The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of prospects for the future.

Discourse Models for Generating Optimized User Interfaces: Theory from AI and Application in HCI</h4>
<p><b>Hermann Kaindl</b></p>

<p>This intermediate-level tutorial shows how human-computer interaction can be based on discourse modeling, even without employing speech or natural language. <i>Communicative acts</i> as abstractions from speech acts can model, for example, a question or an answer. These are glued together as a so-called <i>adjacency pair.</i> Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to <i>ontologies</i> of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify an interaction design. This tutorial also sketches how such an interaction design can be used for automated user-interface generation.</p>

<p>Experience has been gained, for example, having applied this approach to the interaction design and user interface generation for a semi-autonomous robot (in the form of a shopping cart for a supermarket). For small devices like current Smart Phones, these user interfaces are ready for use in real-world applications, through optimization based on heuristic search.</p>

<p>In effect, such user interfaces are generated from models underpinned through theories from artificial intelligence (AI), and these theories are applied to human-computer interaction (HCI) and user-interface generation.</p>

<p>There are no prerequisites such as knowledge about AI or HCI in general, nor on heuristic search in particular.

From Structured Prediction to Inverse Reinforcement Learning</h4>
<p><b>Hal Daume III</b></p>

<p>Machine learning is all about making predictions; in many AI application domains (language, vision, biology) we see lots of complex rich structure. Structured prediction marries these two. However, structured prediction isn't always enough: sometimes the world throws even more complex data at us, and we need reinforcement learning techniques. This tutorial is all about the <i>how</i> and the <i>why</i> of structured prediction and inverse reinforcement learning (also known as inverse optimal control): participants should walk away comfortable that they could implement many structured prediction and IRL algorithms, and have a sense of which ones might work for which problems.</p>

<p>The first half of the tutorial will cover the basics of structured prediction the structured perceptron and Magerman's incremental parsing algorithm. It will then build up to more advanced algorithms that are shockingly reminiscent of these simple approaches: maximum margin techniques and search-based structured prediction.</p>

<p>The second half of the tutorial will ask the question: what happens when our standard assumptions about our data are violated? This is what leads us into the world of reinforcement learning (the basics of which we'll cover) and then to inverse reinforcement learning and inverse optimal control.

Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis</h4>
<p><b>Bing Liu</b></p>

<p>Opinion mining or sentiment analysis is the computational study of people's opinions, appraisals, and emotions toward entities, individuals, topics and their attributes expressed in text. Opinions are important because they are key influencers of our behaviors. Our beliefs and perceptions of reality are to a considerable degree conditioned on how others see the world. For this reason, when we need to make a decision we often seek out the opinions of others. In recent years, opinion mining from social media has emerged as a popular research area in NLP and text mining due to many challenging research problems and a range of applications. It has gone from computer science to reach social sciences and management science. In fact, apart from NLP, it also presents many challenges to other areas of AI, for example, machine learning, data mining, and automated reasoning. In the tutorial, I will first define the problem, describe its main tasks, and then present the current state-of-the-art techniques. Many examples will also be given to help participants better understand the key concepts. One feature of the tutorial is that it will not only address seminal research issues but also will look at the technology from an application angle.</p>

Algorithms for Classical Planning</h4>
<p><b>Jussi Rintanen</b></p>

<p>Planning is a fundamental aspect of the behavior of intelligent beings. Construction of intelligent agents, physical or virtual, often requires the solution of complex forms of the planning problem, identifying sequences of actions that fulfill the performance objectives of the agent. Understanding of planning has made dramatic progress in the last 10 years, tremendously improving its applicability to hard problems requiring intelligent decision making and acting.</p>

<p>The focus of the tutorial is in the most important state-space traversal methods: heuristic state-space search and logic-based symbolic methods such as planning as satisfiability. These directly solve the classical planning problem, but are also the basis of solving its extensions such as temporal and conditional planning. We explain the most important algorithms for classical planning, relations between them, and their applicability to more general planning problems. We also give a practical overview of existing planning systems.</p>

<p>The target audience is AI researchers interested in understanding the landscape of modern planning and the issues arising in their application. As background knowledge we assume a basic understanding of standard search algorithms and logic.</p>

Conformal Predictions for Reliable Machine Learning: Theory and Applications</h4>
<p><b>Vineeth N. Balasubramanian and Shen-Shyang Ho</b></p>

<p>Reliable estimation of confidence remains a significant challenge as learning algorithms proliferate into challenging real-world applications. The Conformal Predictions framework is a recent development in machine learning to associate reliable measures of confidence with results in classification and regression. This framework is founded on the principles of algorithmic randomness, transductive inference and hypothesis testing, and has several desirable properties for potential use in various real-world applications, such as the calibration of the obtained confidence values in an online setting. Further, this framework can be applied across all existing classification and regression methods, thus making it very generalizable. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying this framework to real-world problems such as clinical decision support, medical diagnosis, sea surveillance, network traffic classification, and face recognition. This tutorial will: (1) expose the audience to the basic theory of the framework; (2) demonstrate examples of how the framework can be applied in real-world problems, and (3) provide sample adaptations of the framework to related problems such as active learning, transfer learning, anomaly detection, and model selection.</p>

<p>A basic understanding of machine learning approaches (such as classification, clustering, regression, and others) is the only prerequisite for this tutorial.

Information Organization and Retrieval with Collaboratively Generated Content</h4>
<p><b>Eugene Agichtein and Evgeniy Gabrilovich</b></p>

<p>Ubiquitous access to the Internet enables millions of web users to collaborate online. These efforts often result in the construction of large repositories of knowledge, either as their primary aim (for example, Wikipedia) or as a by-product (for example, Yahoo! Answers). The unprecedented amounts of information in collaboratively generated content (CGC) enable new, knowledge-rich approaches to information access. Some examples include the use of human-defined concepts to augment the bag of words, using large-scale taxonomies to construct additional class-based features, or using Wikipedia for better word sense disambiguation. However, the quality of CGC varies significantly, and a substantial amount of post-processing is necessary to take full advantage of the knowledge therein.</p>

<p>The tutorial will cover two complementary directions: (1) Using CGC as an enabling resource for knowledge-enriched, intelligent information retrieval algorithms, and (2) Development of supporting technologies for extracting, filtering, and organizing CGC.</p>

<p>As we will show, not only the knowledge repositories can be used to improve information retrieval methods, but the reverse pollination is also possible. For example, better information extraction methods can be used to automatically collect more knowledge, or to verify the contributed content.</p>

<p>Understanding of basic concepts in machine learning and data mining is expected. Information retrieval and NLP concepts will be introduced as needed.</p>

Philosophy as AI and AI as Philosophy</h4>
<p><b>Aaron Sloman</b></p>

<p>Although most AI researchers have engineering objectives, some are primarily interested in the scientific study of minds, both natural and artificial. Some of the deep connections between both scientific and applied AI are linked to old problems in philosophy about the nature of mind and knowledge, what exists, how minds are related to matter, about causation and free will, about the nature of consciousness, about how language is possible, about creativity, and about whether non-biological machines can have minds. Questions linking AI and philosophy motivated AI pioneers such as Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and Herbert Simon, and are also addressed by Margaret Boden, Andy Clark, David Chalmers, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, and others. Yet many questions remain unanswered and some philosophers and scientists think AI is only engineering.</p>

<p>I'll try to explain how progress can be based on unnoticed relationships between AI and Philosophy, including the connections of both with unexplained features of biological evolution and the development of various kinds of intelligence in individual animals. The tutorial will be highly interactive and provocative.</p>

<p><i>Prerequisites:</i>: None, except interest in how AI and philosophy are mutually relevant, and illuminate the nature of mind and intelligence. See the <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/aaaitutorial/">author's website</a> for details.</p>
