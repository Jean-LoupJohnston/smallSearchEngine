Building Watson: An Overview of DeepQA for the <i>Jeopardy! Challenge</i></h3>
<p><b>David Ferrucci (IBM T. J. Watson Research Center)</b></p>


<p>Computer systems that can directly and accurately answer peoples' questions over a broad domain of human knowledge have been envisioned by scientists and writers since the advent of computers themselves. Open domain question answering holds tremendous promise for facilitating informed decision making over vast volumes of natural language content. Applications in business intelligence, healthcare, customer support, enterprise knowledge management, social computing, science and government would all benefit from deep language processing. The DeepQA project is aimed at exploring how advancing and integrating natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, massively parallel computation, and knowledge representation and reasoning can greatly advance open-domain automatic Question Answering. An exciting proof-point in this challenge is to develop a computer system that can successfully compete against top human players at the <i>Jeopardy!</i> quiz show. Attaining champion-level performance Jeopardy! requires a computer system to rapidly and accurately answer rich open-domain questions, and to predict its own performance on any given category/question. The system must deliver high degrees of precision and confidence over a very broad range of knowledge and natural language content with a 3-second response time. To do this DeepQA evidences and evaluates many competing hypotheses. A key to success is automatically learning and combining accurate confidences across an array of complex algorithms and over different dimensions of evidence. Accurate confidences are needed to know when to "buzz in" against your competitors and how much to bet. High precision and accurate confidence computations are just as critical for providing real value in business settings where helping users focus on the right content sooner and with greater confidence can make all the difference. The need for speed and high precision demands a massively parallel computing platform capable of generating, evaluating and combing 1000s of hypotheses and their associated evidence. In this talk I will introduce the audience to the <i>Jeopardy! Challenge</i> and how we tackled it using DeepQA.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2011/Photos/ferrucci.jpg" alt="David Ferrucci" width="65" height="75" class="img1" /><b>David Ferrucci</b> is the lead researcher and principal investigator for the Watson/Jeopardy! project. He has been a research staff member at IBM's T. J. Watson's Research Center since 1995 where he heads up the Semantic Analysis and Integration department. Ferrucci focuses on technologies for automatically discovering valuable knowledge in natural language content and using it to enable better decision making.</p>

<p>As part of his research he led the team that developed UIMA. UIMA is a software framework and open standard widely used by industry and academia for collaboratively integrating, deploying and scaling advanced text and multimodal (speech, video) analytics. As chief software architect for UIMA, Ferrucci led its design and chaired the UIMA standards committee at OASIS. The UIMA software framework is deployed in IBM products and has been contributed to Apache open-source to facilitate broader adoption and development.
In 2007, Ferrucci took on the<i> Jeopardy! Challenge</i> &mdash; tasked to create a computer system that can rival human champions at the game of <i>Jeopardy!.</i> As the PI for the exploratory research project dubbed DeepQA, he focused on advancing automatic, open-domain question answering using massively parallel evidence based hypothesis generation and evaluation. By building on UIMA, on key university collaborations and by taking bold research, engineering and management steps, he led his team to integrate and advance many search, natural language processing, and semantic technologies to deliver results that have out-performed all expectations and have demonstrated world-class performance at a task previously thought insurmountable with the current state of the art. Watson, the computer system built by Ferrucci's team is now competing with top <i>Jeopardy!</i> champions. Under his leadership they have already begun to demonstrate how DeepQA can make dramatic advances for intelligent decision support in areas including medicine, finance, publishing, government and law.</p>

<p>Ferrucci has been the principal investigator on several government-funded research programs on automatic question answering, intelligent systems and saleable text analytics. His team at IBM consists of 28 researchers and software engineers specializing in the areas of natural language processing, software architecture, information retrieval, machine learning and knowledge representation and reasoning.</p>

<p>Ferrucci graduated from Manhattan College with a BS in biology and from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1994 with a PhD in computer science specializing in knowledge representation and reasoning. He is published in the areas of AI, knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language processing, and automatic question-answering.</p>

Towards Artificial Systems: What Can We Learn From Human Perception?</h3>
<p><b>Heinrich H. Buelthoff (Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics)</b></p>


<p>Recent progress in learning algorithms and sensor hardware has led to rapid advances in artificial systems. However, their performance continues to fall short of the efficiency and plasticity of human behavior. In many ways, a deeper understanding of how humans process and act upon physical sensory information can contribute to the development of better artificial systems. In this presentation, Buelthoff will highlight how the latest tools in computer vision, computer graphics, and virtual reality technology can be used to systematically understand the factors that determine how humans behave and solve tasks in realistic scenarios.</p>

From Turn-Taking to Social Ties</h3>
<p><b>Karrie Karahalios (University of Illinois)</b></p>

<p>Online communities have been studied from various perspectives since the 1980s. Much of this work has taken existing sociology techniques and molded them to fit a specific electronic environment such as IRC, Usenet, Facebook, and others. The existence of digital traces of online interaction has made this research possible at a large scale.</p>

<p>In this talk, Karahalios begins by discussing a brief history of the study of online interaction and the cues used by researchers to formulate their research. She continues describing how the study of online social spaces has changed through the lens of the work done in the Social Spaces Group. Karahalios argues that digital traces can be misleading and new techniques and interfaces are necessary to improve and study social online interaction. This discussion includes work highlighting the differences between interaction between rural and urban areas, tie strength from social network software, and implications of this work. Finally, Karahalios concludes by highlighting how online social interaction is diverging from face-to-face interaction and the importance of new methodologies and interfaces for studying this change.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2011/Photos/karahalios.jpg" alt="Karrie Karahalios" width="56" height="75" class="img1" /><b>Karrie Karahalios</b> is an associate professor in computer science at the University of Illinois where she heads the Social Spaces Group. Her work focuses on the interaction between people and the social cues they emit and perceive in networked electronic spaces.  Her work is informed by studies and visualizations of social communities. Of particular interest are interfaces for pubic online and physical gathering spaces such as twitter, chatrooms, cafes, parks, and others. One goal is to create interfaces that enable users to perceive conversational patterns that are present, but not obvious, in traditional communication interfaces. Karahalios completed a S.B. in electrical engineering, an M.Eng. in electrical engineering and computer science, and an S.M. and Ph.D in media arts and science at MIT.</p>

Strategic Intelligence in Social Networks</h3>
<p><b>Michael Kearns (University of Pennsylvania)</b></p>


<p>For the past six years at Penn, we have been conducting controlled human-subject experiments on strategic interaction in social networks. The overarching goal of these experiments is to provide a behavioral counterpart to the flourishing research on mathematical models of social networks, diffusion dynamics, influence in social networks, and related topics.</p>

<p>To date we have conducted experiments on a wide variety of strategic and computational tasks in social networks, including graph coloring (which can be viewed as a problem of social differentiation), consensus, biased voting, trading and bargaining in networks, and network formation. These experiments have yielded a wealth of findings and data on the ability of human subjects to solve challenging collective tasks from only local interactions, and have shed light on basic topics such as influence and altruism in social networks, and the relationship between network structure and collective and individual performance and behavior. The experiments also raise interesting challenges for notions of collective intelligence in humans and machines, and for the application of machine learning to the resulting data.</p>

Registration and Recognition for Robotics</h3>
<p><b>Kurt Konolige (Willow Garage, Inc and Stanford University)</b></p>

<p>Robotic manipulation around the home and office requires perception of the environment and objects within it. In this talk, Konolige highlights the key roles played by visual registration. The first role is in keeping track of where the robot is, and for understanding how multiple views of the environment correspond to each other. The second is in finding and manipulating objects in the world. Registration and recognition methods will be illustrated with examples from Willow Garage's PR2 robot.</p>
