<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA1">SA1:</a> </i> Learn to Write a Scientific Paper of the Future: Reproducible Research, Open Science, and Digital Scholarship</h3>
<p><b>Daniel Garijo, Yolanda Gil, and Gail Peretsman-Clement</b></p>

<p>This tutorial covers best practices in reproducible research, open science, and digital scholarship that help researchers increase citations for their papers, get credit for all their research products, augment their vitae with data and software that they have written, write compelling data management plans for funding proposals, comply with new funder and journal requirements, and practice open and reproducible science. We begin with a motivation for authors through an overview of why scientists, publishers, funders, and the public care about science practices. Next, we describe how to make research data accessible through publication in a public repository, including metadata, a license for reuse, and citable using a unique and persistent identifier. We then show how to make software accessible by making it available in a public repository, with a license, and a unique and citable persistent identifier. We also cover how to document in a software registry key information that helps others reuse research software. We then discuss how to document provenance and methods by explicitly describing related computations and outcomes in a workflow sketch, a formal workflow, or a provenance record, possibly with a persistent identifier. Finally, we provide a summary checklist for authors, and show how to manage their scholarly identity, reputation, and impact throughout their careers.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA2">SA2:</a> </i> Risk-Averse Decision Making and Control</h3>
<p><b>Marek Petrik and Mohammad Ghavamzadeh</b></p>

<p>Practical deployments often require risk-averse solutions, but most decision-making methods maximize the expected rewards. The operations research community has made significant progress in risk-averse decision-making by building on the conditional value at risk (CVaR) and the framework of convex risk measures. These principled approaches to risk-aversion are now also gaining traction in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Unfortunately, many recent advances on convex risk measures are not readily accessible to the artificial intelligence community because they are published in unfamiliar venues and are often presented in an overly technical manner. This tutorial will combine recent results from relevant communities to describe risk-sensitive methods in a way that is accessible to people with artificial intelligence and machine learning background. We will introduce and motivate convex measures of risk and describe efficient methods to optimize them in decision-making, control, planning, and reinforcement learning. We will also describe connections to robust optimization and to expected utility models, such as the relationship between entropic risk measures and exponential utility. The tutorial will include practical problems in which risk-sensitivity was used in both machine learning and operations research including the successes and difficulties with risk aversion in dynamic decision problems.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA3">SA3:</a> </i> Rulelog: Deep KRR for Cognitive Computing</h3>
<p><b>Benjamin Grosof, Michael Kifer, and Paul Fodor</b></p>

<p>In this half-day tutorial, we cover the fundamental concepts, key technologies, emerging applications, recent progress, and outstanding research issues in the area of Rulelog, a leading approach to rule-based knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR). Rulelog matches well many of the requirements of cognitive computing. It combines deep logical/probabilistic reasoning tightly with natural language processing, and complements machine learning. Rulelog interoperates and composes well with graph databases, relational databases, spreadsheets, XML, and expressively simpler rule/ontology systems &mdash; and can orchestrate overall hybrid KRR. Developed mainly since 2005, Rulelog is <i>much</i> more representationally powerful than the previous state-of-the-art practical KRR approaches, yet is computationally affordable. It is fully semantic and has capable efficient implementations that leverage methods from logic programming and databases, including dependency-aware smart caching and a dynamic compilation stack architecture.</p>

<p>Rulelog extends Datalog (database logic) with general classical-logiclike formulas &mdash; including existentials and disjunctions &mdash; and strong capabilities for meta knowledge and reasoning, including higher-order syntax, flexible defeasibility and probabilistic uncertainty, and restraint bounded rationality that ensures worst-case polynomial time for query answering. A large subset of Rulelog is in draft as an industry standard. An exciting research frontier is that Rulelog can combine closely with machine learning and with natural language processing to both interpret and generate English, including potentially for conversational NL interaction.</p>

<p>The most complete system today for Rulelog is Ergo from Coherent Knowledge. A subset of Rulelog is also implemented in an open-source Flora-2 system and an earlier SILK system from Vulcan. Using Ergo, we will illustrate Rulelog's applications in deep reasoning and representing complex knowledge &mdash; such as policies, regulations/contracts, science, and terminology mappings &mdash; across a wide range of tasks and domains in business, government, and academe. Examples include: legal/policy compliance, for example, in financial services; financial reporting/accounting; health care treatment guidance and insurance; education/tutoring; security/confidentiality policies; and e-commerce marketing.</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> Background assumed of participants is only the basics of first-order-logic and relational databases.</p>

<p>The target audience is those who are interested in learning more about knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) as a core area in AI, and about how it relates to cognitive computing's applications as well as conceptual architecture. Together with machine learning (ML) and natural language interaction (NLI), KRR forms the tripod basis for the core of AI and cognitive computing. The audience will walk away with an understanding of Rulelog's key innovative logical and inferencing concepts, its broad applicability, its overall advantages and limitations, a sample of some specific application areas, and its open research topics.</p>

<p><i><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/Photos/Grosof.jpg" alt="Benjamin Grosof" width="87" height="75" class="img1" />Benjamin Grosof</i> (lead presenter) principal director and research fellow in AI at Accenture, is a technical executive for an ambitious initiative on leveraging AI for business process automation across Accenture's $7.5B+ Operations group.  He is an industry leader in AI knowledge representation, reasoning, and acquisition. He has pioneered semantic technology and industry standards for rules combined with ontologies, their acquisition from natural language, and their applications in finance, e-commerce, policies (including contracts, regulations, and security), and e-learning. He cofounded Coherent Knowledge, a software-centric startup that is commercializing a major research breakthrough in AI logical / probabilistic knowledge representation and reasoning (Rulelog) combined with natural language processing. Previously he was CTO and CEO of Coherent Knowledge (2013-2017; he is still a board member), and a senior research program manager at Vulcan Inc. (2007-2013), where he conceived and led the advanced research third of the predecessor of the Allen Institute for AI. Before Vulcan, he was an IT professor at MIT Sloan (2000-2007), where he was also a DARPA PI, and a senior software scientist at IBM Research (1988-2000). He cofounded the influential RuleML industry standards design effort and prototyped it in SweetRules, the main bases for the W3C Rule Interchange Format (RIF) standard. He cofounded the International Conference on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the semantic web (which since became the RR and RuleML conferences and then the International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning). He led the invention of several fundamental technical advances in knowledge representation, including courteous defeasibility (exception-case rules), restraint bounded rationality (scalability in complex reasoning), and rule-based description logic ontologies (the basis for W3C's OWL RL standard). He also has extensive experience in user interaction design, and in combining logical methods with machine learning and probabilistic reasoning uncertainty. His background includes 5 major industry software releases, 5 years in software startups, his own part-time expert consulting firm, a Stanford PhD in AI, a Harvard BA in applied math, 3 patents, and over 60 refereed publications.</p>

<p>Grosof has given numerous invited talks about knowledge representation, reasoning, and acquisition, including with semantic rules, and developed several MIT courses with substantial focus on those. He presented with coauthors (including usually Michael Kifer since 2009) related tutorials on reasoning with complex knowledge at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2013), International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2001, 2016), the International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP 2015), International Semantic Web Conference (2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2012), the WWW conference (2006, 2009), the International Web Rule Symposium joint with the Reasoning Web Summer School (2015), and the ACM Conference on E-Commerce (2004).</p>

<p><b>Sam Ganzfried, Johannes Heinrich, and Kevin Waugh</b></p>

<p>Poker has been studied academically since the founding of game theory and in fact may have even been the inspiration for the field: the only motivating problem described in John Nash's PhD thesis, which defined and proved existence of the central solution concept, was actually a three-player poker game. Such interest has not waned over time. Last year when a computer program developed at Carnegie Mellon University competed against the strongest human two-player no-limit Texas hold 'em players in the inaugural Brains versus Artificial Intelligence Competition, thousands of poker fans followed with excitement. Earlier that year another monumental breakthrough was attained, as the two-player limit variation of Texas hold 'em (the smallest variant played competitively by humans) was essentially weakly solved (that is, an epsilon-Nash equilibrium was computed for such a small epsilon to be statistically indistinguishable from zero in a human lifetime) by researchers at the University of Alberta. This result was published in <i>Science.</i> Poker, and particularly Texas hold 'em, is tremendously popular for humans, and online poker is a multibillion dollar industry. Computer poker has proved to be one of the most visible applications of research in computational game theory.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SP2">SP2:</a> </i> Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence: Logic, Probability and Computation</h3>
<p><b>Luc De Raedt, David Poole, Kristian Kersting, and Sriraam Natarajan</b></p>

<p>
Both predicate logic and probability theory extend propositional logic, one by adding relations, individuals and quantified variables, the other by allowing for measures over possible worlds and conditional queries. While logical and probabilistic approaches have often been studied and used independently within artificial intelligence, they are not in conflict with each other but they are synergistic. Indeed, there has been a considerable body of research in combining first-order logic and probability in the area known as statistical relational artificial intelligence (StarAI).</p>

<p>Relational probabilistic models &mdash; we use this term in the broad sense, meaning any models that combine relations and probabilities &mdash; form the basis of StarAI, and can be seen as combinations of probability and predicate calculus that allow for individuals and relations as well as probabilities. In building on top of relational models, StarAI goes far beyond reasoning, optimization, learning and acting optimally in terms of a fixed number of features or variables, as it is typically studied in machine learning, constraint satisfaction, probabilistic reasoning, and other areas of AI. This tutorial provides a gentle introduction to the state of the art and the current challenges in StarAI.</p>

<p><b>Roman Bart&aacute;k and Neng-Fa Zhou</b></p>

<p>Picat is a logic-based multiparadigm language that integrates logic programming, functional programming, constraint programming, and scripting. Picat takes many features from other languages, including logic variables, unification, backtracking, pattern-matching rules, functions, list/array comprehensions, loops, assignments, tabling for dynamic programming and planning, and constraint solving with CP (constraint programming), SAT (satisfiability), and MIP (mixed integer programming).</p>

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to show how to declaratively model some classical AI problems, including constraint satisfaction and planning problems, and solve them efficiently using Picat. The tutorial is targeted toward researchers who are interested in AI algorithms and need a high-level modeling tool for rapid prototyping and efficient solving of AI problems. The audience will learn the basics of the Picat language and its programming, and some general techniques and tricks for modeling constraint satisfaction and planning problems. Modeling has been an important topic in constraint programming and operations research. However, modeling in planning has received little attention. The major novelty of the tutorial is to show how declarative and concise models in Picat can lead to efficient solutions. There will also be sessions explaining how high-level models are compiled to encodings for fast solving by existing solvers.</p>

<p>Water is unique in its role as a life preserver. It is important to all members of a society, who can benefit with decision support aids (that is, AI systems) which can help them understand water pollution data and alternative decision choices that they may have.</p>

<p>The aim of the tutorial is to make both early and experienced researchers aware of the water management area, its issues and opportunities for using AI techniques to make real world impact that matters. In particular, we discuss available open water pollution data, both quantitative and qualitative in nature from a modality of sensors, that researchers can use to help a wide spectrum of decision makers, for example, farmers, tourists, environmentalists, health officials, policy makers and businesses. We ground the presentation based on our work in (1) using open data released by government agencies, (2) developing data platform and mobile apps, (3) developing use-cases benefiting from pollution data like tourism and industry inspection, and (4) field experiments at polluted rivers in India like Yamuna at Delhi, Hindon at Meerut and Ganga at Haridwar with multiple sensors for these use-cases. Among systems referenced, BlueWater is a data platform to collect, reconcile and share quantitative pollution data from real-time sensors and historical data, and powers the released GangaWatch mobile app to make sense from all. Since mobile phones are omnipresent, mobile apps like CreekWatch on iOS and Neer Bandhu (Water Friend) on Android enable people to share qualitative assessment of water quality and validate physical sensing. The collected data is released to community via APIs.</p>

<p><b>Fred Morstatter and Huan Liu</b></p>

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to introduce how data issues can lead to inaccurate models and research conclusions. These biases arise across a wide swath of artificial intelligence tasks, from biases in computer vision to social media data. These biases lead to machine learning models that make spurious predictions. Using social media as an example, these biases can stem from the make up of user base (demographic bias), as well as from malicious users who try to manipulate the discussion on the site (malicious user bias). Sampling strategies from the sites themselves lead to data that is not based on human activity (sample bias). Furthermore, these sampling strategies can be manipulated to tamper with research performed from these data outlets (malicious sample bias). In this tutorial we will discuss how these representativity issues can lead to misinformed conclusions based upon data from social media, as well as incorrect machine learning models. We will demonstrate case studies of how the results of these biased data sources cause fundamental errors in data analysis. Finally, we will present approaches for correcting for this bias, enabling increased credibility and generalizability of research.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUA2">SUA2:</a> </i> Learning Bayesian Networks for Complex Relational Data</h3>
<p><b>Oliver Schulte and Ted Kirkpatrick</b></p>

<p>Many organizations maintain critical data in a relational database. The tutorial describes the statistical and algorithmic challenges of constructing models from such data, compared to the single-table data that is the traditional emphasis of machine learning. We extend the popular model of Bayesian networks to relational data, integrating probabilistic associations across all tables in the database. Extensive research has shown that such models, accounting for relationships between entities (such as actors featured in a movie, or ratings of movies by viewers), have greater predictive accuracy than models learned without relational information. We illustrate the challenges in learning such models, and their solutions, in a real-life running example, the Internet Movie Database. The tutorial shows how Bayesian networks support several relational learning tasks, such as querying multirelational frequencies, link-based classification, and relational anomaly detection. We describe how standard machine learning concepts can be extended and adapted for relational data, such as sufficient statistics, model likelihood, model selection, and statistical consistency.</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> The tutorial is self-contained as it addresses both researchers with a background in machine learning, but possibly none in logic, and researchers with a background in logic, but possibly none in machine learning.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUA3">SUA3:</a> </i> Causal Inference and the Data-Fusion Problem</h3>
<p><b>Elias Barenboim</b></p>
<p>Machine Learning is usually dichotomized into two categories, passive (such as supervised learning) and active (such as reinforcement learning) which, by and large, are studied separately. Reality is more demanding. Passive and active modes of operation are but two extremes of a rich spectrum of data-collection modes (also called research designs) that generate the bulk of the data available in practical, large scale situations. In typical medical explorations, for example, data from multiple observations and experiments are collected, coming from distinct experimental setups, different sampling conditions, and heterogeneous populations. Similarly, in a more basic setting, a baby learns from its environment by both passively observing others and interacting with its environment by actively performing interventions.</p>
    
<p>In this tutorial, we will review concepts, principles, and mathematical tools that were found useful in reasoning about passive and active modes of interaction, how these modes relate to causal and counterfactual reasoning, and how these results have been used in data-intensive sciences. In particular, we will introduce the data-fusion problem, which is concerned with piecing together multiple datasets collected under heterogeneous conditions (to be defined) so as to obtain valid answers to queries of interest. The tutorial will include discussions on issues of confounding control, policy analysis, misspecification tests, heterogeneity, selection bias, and reinforcement learning.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUA4">SUA4:</a> </i> Eliciting High-Quality Information</h3>
<p><b>Boi Faltings and Goran Radanovic</b></p>

<p>AI systems often depend on information provided by other agents, for example sensor data or crowdsourced human computation. Usually, providing accurate and relevant data requires costly effort that agents may not always be willing to provide. Thus, it becomes important both to verify the correctness of data, but&nbsp;also to provide incentives so that agents that provide high-quality data are rewarded while those that do not are discouraged by low rewards.</p>

<p>We will cover different settings and the assumptions they admit, including sensing, human computation, peer grading, reviews and predictions. We will survey different incentive mechanisms, including proper scoring rules, prediction markets and peer prediction, Bayesian truth serum, peer truth serum, and the settings where each of them would be suitable. As an alternative, we also consider reputation mechanisms. We complement the game-theoretic analysis with practical examples of applications in prediction platforms, community sensing and peer grading.</p>

<p>This tutorial is intended for AI researchers and practitioners working with contributed or crowdsourced data, be it in machine learning, AI on the web, sensing and computational sustainability, or optimization.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUP1">SUP1:</a> </i> Interactive Machine Learning: From Classifiers to Robotics</h3>
<p><b>Brad Hayes, Ece Kamar, and Matthew E. Taylor</b></p>

<p>To make virtual agents and physical robots solve real-world tasks, it often becomes necessary to learn not only from static datasets or simulated oracles, but directly from humans. Unfortunately, some of the assumptions underlying traditional statistical machine learning approaches become invalid when learning from data provided by slow, inaccurate, or inconsistent trainers. Furthermore, many additional considerations that are typically outside the purview of machine learning experts, such as user interface, become critical. This tutorial will (1) survey selected existing work in this exciting and growing field; (2) propose a framework to classify and understand different types of work in this area, as well as highlight important opportunities for additional work; and (3) cover a selection of practical considerations, such as participant recruitment and compensation, and useful toolkits or testbeds.</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> The majority of the material in this tutorial will be understandable without any domain expertise. There will sections in which having a background in machine learning at the level of a one-semester graduate class will be useful for understanding algorithmic details.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUP2">SUP2:</a> </i> Knowledge Graph Construction from Text</h3>
<p><b>Jay Pujara, Sameer Singh, and Bhavana Dalvi</b></p>

<p>With the proliferation of large collections of unstructured text, the problem of extracting structured knowledge and integrating it into a coherent knowledge graph has become increasingly important. From Siri to summarization, knowledge graphs have become an integral component of many applications. Due to its importance, this area has been an active area of research spanning areas of natural language processing, information extraction, information integration, databases, search, and machine learning.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will present an accessible and structured overview of the existing approaches for extracting candidate facts from text and incorporating these into a well-formed knowledge graph. The first half of this tutorial will cover knowledge extraction, with a focus on the underlying NLP tasks and successful approaches for converting text into candidate facts. The second half of the tutorial will focus on machine learning approaches such as tensor factorization, deep learning, probabilistic graphical models, and random walk strategies for integrating candidate facts into a complete and coherent knowledge graph.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our approach includes identifying the common themes and challenges in the area, and comparing and contrasting the existing approaches on the basis of these aspects. We will highlight the key applications, useful datasets, and prominent tools for knowledge graph construction, and offer practical advice. We believe our unifying framework will provide the necessary tools and perspectives to enable the newcomers to the field to explore, evaluate, and develop novel techniques for automated knowledge graph construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> The tutorial is designed to be self-contained, but familiarity with the basic concepts from artificial intelligence and related fields will be helpful.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUP3">SUP3:</a> </i> Introduction to multiAgent Path Finding</h3>
<p><b>Ariel Felner, Sven Koenig, and Glenn Wagner</b></p>

<p>Teams of agents often have to assign target locations among themselves and then plan collision-free paths to their target locations. Examples include automated warehouse systems, office robots and game characters in video games. The resulting multiAgent Path Finding (MAPF) problem is NP-hard to solve optimally and even NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor less than 4/3. It has been studied in artificial intelligence, robotics and theoretical computer science.</p>

<p>The tutorial will describe different variants of the MAPF problem (including their complexity), different approaches to solve these variants and their applications, including considerations for using them on real robots. The tutorial will cover a variety of optimal approaches (including dedicated algorithms and reductions to other well-studied problems, such as satisfiability), suboptimal approaches and fast but incomplete approaches.</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> Participants are only expected to be familiar with standard single-agent path-finding techniques (such as A* and RRTs).</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SUP4">SUP4:</a> </i> Predicting Human Decision-Making: Tools of the Trade</h3>
<p><b>Ariel Rosenfeld and Sarit Kraus</b></p>

<p>Human decision-making often transcends our formal models of rationality. Designing intelligent agents that interact proficiently with people necessitates the modeling of human behavior and the prediction of their decisions.</p>

<p>In this three and a half hour tutorial, we will focus on the prediction of human decision-making and its use in designing intelligent human-aware automated agents of varying natures; from purely conflicting interaction settings (for example, security and games) to fully cooperative interaction settings (for example, advise provision, human rehabilitation). We will present computational representations, algorithms and empirical methodologies for meeting the challenges that arise from the above tasks in both a single interaction (one-shot) and repeated interaction settings. The tutorial will also review recent advances, current challenges and future directions for the field</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> In the course of the tutorial we will present techniques and ideas using machine learning, game-theoretical and general AI concepts. The basis for these concepts will be covered as part of the tutorial; however, a basic familiarity with the above concepts is encouraged.</p>
