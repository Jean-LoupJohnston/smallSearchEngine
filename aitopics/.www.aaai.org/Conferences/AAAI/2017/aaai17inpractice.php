<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Witbrock">Slot 3: Invited Talk</a> <br /></i>AI for Complex Situations: Beyond Uniform Problem Solving</h3>
<p><b>Michael Witbrock (IBM)</b></p>

<p>The majority of recent technical advances in AI stem from problems that are structurally fairly uniform, but have complex and hard-to-describe patterns of variation within that structure. This structural uniformity characterizes, for example, speech signals up to transcription, text up to approximate translation, information extraction, video game play, lane-following, object labeling, and even the game of Go. However, many of the problems that we typically write programs for do not appear to be structurally uniform in this way: understanding a contract, or a regulation, and deciding how it affects a particular business process, is structurally complex: each detail of how the elements of the problem instance relate to one another is potentially critical. General reading comprehension, or automated programming seem similarly complex. If we are to produce AI systems that provide professional level assistance, we must address this complexity along with the variation. In this talk, I will discuss some of the complex, professional level problems we are attempting to address at IBM, and sketch some research paths, from both the past and possible future of AI.

Michael Witbrock is a Distinguished Research Staff Member at IBM Research where he leads the Learning to Reason department, and coordinates global research efforts in knowledge extraction and knowledge representation. Michael recently joined IBM after an extended period as Vice President for Research at Cycorp, where he directed research projects in automated reasoning (including speed-up learning), automated and interactive knowledge acquisition, and machine reading, in domains as varied as military operations planning, counter terrorism, NL medical records query, code analysis and vulnerability detection, video analysis and retrieval, and the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer. Before joining Cycorp, Michael was Principal Scientist at Terra Lycos, working on integrating statistical and knowledge based approaches to understanding web user behavior, and IP capture; a research scientist at JustSystems Pittsburgh Research Center, working on statistical summarization; and a systems scientist at Carnegie Mellon on the Informedia visual and spoken document information retrieval project. While maintaining a strong interest in knowledge representation and capture and in natural language understanding, his current research goals involve the development and use of quasi-logics, which retain approximations of the formal properties of logic while adding the learnability and flexibility of distributed representations, and the development and application of large, inferentially productive knowledge bases and inference systems across the resulting range of reasoning paradigms. He hopes to apply these representations and reasoners to the construction of "dense models" of domains, which are sufficiently complete support the full range of in-domain reasoning. He is author of numerous publications in areas ranging across computational linguistics, speech modeling and recognition, neural networks, automated inference, automated reading and multimedia information retrieval, and has dabbled in web browser design and implementation, genetic design and parallel computer architecture. As well as his technical work, Michael is very interested in entrepreneurship around AI and for social good, and in the social and economic outcomes of advances in AI. He has been pursuing the former interest as a member of the board of StartOut, and the latter interest, inter alia, as a co-founder of AI4Good.org. Michael has a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and a BSc Hons in Psychology from Otago University in New Zealand.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Marcus">Slot 4: Invited Keynote</a> <br /></i>Artificial Intelligence, Local Minima, and the Quest for AGI</h3>
<p><b>Gary Marcus (Uber and NYU)</b></p>

<p>
AGI (or artificial general intelligence) is the quest for superhuman machines that have the flexibility and resourcefulness of human intelligence, but the computational power and resources of machines. Recently we have seen some impressive advances in artificial intelligence, but the <i>general</i> in artificial general intelligence is still lacking (despite some apparent counterexamples). By and large, machines still need to be programmed for particular tasks, or failing that to be provided with enormous numbers of supervised training examples that pertain largely to a single task. Most AI software remains narrowly engineered, to specific tasks.
</p>

<p>
In this talk I will try to assess why progress has been slower than many of us might have anticipated, and examine some possible obstacles to progress, and suggest that &mdash; all recent enthusiasm to the contrary &mdash; the field could be headed for a local minimum, solving some problems extremely well, yet still falling far short of what is theoretically possible. I will close by suggesting a few relatively unpopular avenues that might be worth exploring.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Vanhoucke">Slot 5: Invited Talk</a> <br /></i>"OK Google, fold my laundry s'il te pla&icirc;t"</h3>
<p><b>Vincent Vanhoucke (Google)</b></p>

<p>Deep learning has enabled computers to approach human-level performance on many practical perception and language understanding tasks, ranging from speech recognition to computer vision and machine translation. One of today's grand AI challenges is to bring these new capabilities into the physical world, and teach machines how to behave and make themselves useful in human-centered environments. In this talk, I'll argue how robotics may be on the cusp of its very own deep learning revolution, but that for this endeavor to succeed, machine learning practitioners have to break from the relative comfort of the large-scale supervised learning setting that has buoyed the field for the past decade and humbly face some thorny problems that have comparatively been neglected: data scarcity and skill transfer, active and lifelong learning, as well as safety and predictability. The good news is that tackling these problems is also one of the necessary next steps towards bridging the gap between mere learning and actual intelligence.

<p><b>Alex Smola (Amazon)</b></p>

<p>In this talk I will address the challenges of building deep learning systems that are able to adjust to users for content recommendation and user engagement estimation. They rely on nonparametric latent variable models, such as LSTMs to deal with nonstationary time-series data. Going beyond models, I will discuss how scalable deep learning models can be implemented efficiently in MxNet, a parallel distributed high performance deep learning framework. In particular, I will discuss programming models, its execution engine and how to distribute computation efficiently over hundreds of GPUs with linear scaling.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Kurzweil">Slot 7: Fireside Chat</a> <br /></i>The Future Capability and Impact of AI</h3>
<p><b>Fireside Chat with Ray Kurzweil</b></p>

<p>I'll briefly recount my fifty year experience in AI. It began with my meeting Marvin Minsky in 1962 when I was fourteen which began a 54 year mentorship until his passing a year ago. That same month I also met Frank Rosenblatt, then leader of the nascent connectionist school. He shared an intuition with me which would be proven correct decades after his passing in 1971.</p>

<p>
Deep Neural Nets and Long-Short Temporal Memory techniques, along with the ongoing progression of what I call the "Law of Accelerating Returns" (the exponential growth of the price-performance and capacity of information technologies, which is a much broader phenomenon than Moore's Law) is fueling a wave of optimism in AI. But DNNs and LSTMs have a limitation characterized by the motto "life  begins at a billion examples."
</p>

<p>
I'll share an alternative model based on self-organizing hierarchies of sequential models and explain why I believe that this is how the human neocortex works, and why this approach has the potential to overcome the apparent limitations of big DNNs.
</p>

<p>
I would then like to explore these ideas and get questions from the insightful AAAI audience.
</p>

<p><b>Xavier Amatriain (Quora)</b></p>

<p>There are many good textbooks and courses where you can be introduced to machine learning and maybe even learn some of the most intricate details about a particular approach or algorithm. While understanding that theory is a very important base and starting point, there are many other practical issues related to building real-life ML systems that you don't usually hear about. In this talk I will share some of the most important lessons learned in years of building the large-scale ML solutions that power products like Quora or Netflix to delight millions of users across the world. I will discuss issues such as model and feature complexity, sampling, regularization, distributing/parallelizing algorithms, the importance of metrics, or how to think about offline vs. online computation. I will also address how to combine supervised and non-supervised approaches, the deep learning "hype," or the role of ensembles in practical ML systems.</p>
