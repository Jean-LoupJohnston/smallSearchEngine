Goal Reasoning: Emerging Applications, a Foundation, and Prospects </h3>
<p><b>David W. Aha (Naval Research Laboratory, USA)</b></p>

<p>Goal reasoning (GR) has a bright future as a foundation for research on intelligent agents and as a methodology for developing applications. GR is the study of agents that can deliberate on and self-select their goals/objectives, which is a desirable capability for deliberative autonomy. While it has been studied for several decades in multiple disciplines, GR has only recently been the focus of intense interest. In this presentation, I will introduce GR, relate it to other AI topics, summarize some emerging applications, describe our foundation for GR, and discuss some current and future research directions.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/Photos/aha.jpg" alt="David W. Aha" width="62" height="75" class="img1" />David W. Aha (UCI 1990) is a member of NRL's Navy Center for Applied Research on AI.

The Consilience of Neural and Artificial Reinforcement Learning </h3>
<p><b>Peter Dayan (Gatsby Unit, University College London, UK)</b></p>


<p>
Animals that fail to predict or control events associated with rewards and punishments are not long for this world. Reinforcement learning thus offers a body of theory that organizes and motivates a huge wealth of work in psychology and neuroscience. Equally, these latter disciplines provide inspiration for new methods, ideas and problems in the wider field of reinforcement learning. I will discuss this consilience, illustrating the fecundity of the approaches and some of the challenges and opportunities ahead.
</p>

Self-Driving Cars and the Future of Mobility</h3>
<p><b>Dmitri Dolgov (Waymo)</b></p>


<p>In the US, more than 35,000 people die in car accidents every year; 100 million hours are wasted every day on people's commutes. We can do better. Self-driving cars offer a promise of higher safety, efficiency, and convenience in transportation. At Waymo (formerly Google's self-driving car project), we're working to bring self-driving technology to millions of people. In 2015, we took a major step towards that goal: we performed the world's first fully driverless ride on public roads in an uncontrolled setting. This talk will cover the technology behind fully self-driving cars and how they're able to safely share the roads with pedestrians, cyclists and other road users.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/Photos/dolgov.jpg" alt="Dmitri Dolgov" width="59" height="75" class="img1" />Dmitri Dolgov is a distinguished engineer and the head of self-driving technology at Waymo.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Frank">IAAI-17 Invited Talk</a></i><br />Enabling Autonomous Space Mission Operations with Artificial Intelligence<br />
</h3>
<p><b>Jeremy Frank (Intelligent Systems Division, NASA Ames Research Center)</b></p>
<p>
For over 50 years, NASA's crewed missions have been confined to the Earth-Moon system, where speed-of-light communications delays between crew and ground are practically nonexistent. This ground-centered mode of operations, with a large, ground-based support team, is not sustainable for NASA's future human exploration missions to Mars. Future astronauts will need smarter tools to make decisions on their own, without assistance from ground-based mission control. In this talk, we will describe several demonstrations of astronaut decision support tools using AI techniques including automated planning, fault diagnosis, automated reasoning and machine learning. These demonstrations show how developments in AI will enable humanity's journey to Mars. 
</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Grauman">AAAI-17 Invited Talk</a></i><br />Learning How to Move and Where to Look from Unlabeled Video<br />
</h3>
<p><b>Kristen Grauman (University of Texas at Austin, USA)</b><br /><i>Sponsored by Capital One</i></p>


<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/Photos/grauman.jpg" alt="Kristen Grauman" width="54" height="75" class="img1" />The status quo in visual recognition is to learn from batches of unrelated Web photos labeled by human annotators. Yet cognitive science tells us that perception develops in the context of acting and moving in the world &mdash; and without intensive supervision. How can unlabeled video augment computational visual learning? I'll describe our recent work exploring how a system can learn effective representations by watching unlabeled video. Fist we consider how the ego-motion signals accompanying a video provide a valuable cue during learning, allowing the system to internalize the link between "how I move" and "what I see." Next, I explore how the temporal coherence of video permits new forms of invariant feature learning, whether by capturing how object-centric regions evolve over time or by representing higher order consistency in visual changes. Incorporating these ideas into various recognition tasks, we demonstrate the power in learning from ongoing, unlabeled visual observations &mdash; even overtaking traditional heavily supervised approaches in some cases. Finally, I examine how simply having seen unlabeled human-taken videos, a system can learn to mimic human videographer tendencies, automatically creating normal field of view video out of unedited 360 degree panoramas.</p>

<p>Kristen Grauman is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. Her research in computer vision and machine learning focuses on visual search and object recognition. Before joining UT Austin in 2007, she received her Ph.D. from MIT.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Picard">AAAI-17 Invited Talk</a> <br /></i>Adventures in Building Emotional Intelligence Technologies</h3>
<p><b>Rosalind Picard (MIT and Empatica, USA)</b></p>

<p>
Years ago, I set out to create technology with emotional intelligence, demonstrating the ability to sense, recognize, and respond intelligently to human emotion. At MIT we designed studies, gathered data, and developed signal processing and machine learning techniques to see what insights could be reliably obtained. In this talk I will highlight the most surprising findings during this adventure. These include new insights about the "true smile of happiness," discovering new ways cameras (and your smartphone, even in your handbag) can compute your biosignals, finding electrical signals on the wrist that reveal insight into deep brain activity, and learning surprising implications of wearable sensing for autism, anxiety, sleep, memory, epilepsy, and more. What is the biggest challenge for AI to solve next?

Convex and Combinatorial Optimization for Dynamic Robots in the Real World</h3>
<p><b>
Russ Tedrake (MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Toyota Research Institute, USA)</b></p>


<p>
Humanoid robots walking across intermittent terrain, robotic arms grasping multifaceted objects, or UAVs darting left or right around a tree ... many of the dynamics and control problems we face today have both rich nonlinear dynamics and an inherently combinatorial structure. In this talk, Tedrake will review some recent work on planning and control methods which address these two challenges simultaneously. He will present our explorations with mixed-integer convex-, semidefinite-programming-relaxations, and satisfiability-modulo-theory(SMT)-based methods applied to hard problems in legged locomotion over rough terrain, grasp optimization, and UAVs flying through highly cluttered environments.

<p>
A New York Times Magazine article recently announced "The Great A.I. Awakening": The rise of Recognition Systems based on machine learning methods and neural networks, and their use by commercial firms. This view predominates inside and outside of the AI community. Yet this view neglects AI's previous awakenings. 
</p>

<p>
In 1985, Allen Newell, AAAI's first President, wrote: "There is no doubt, as far as I am concerned, that the development of expert systems is the major advance in the field during the last decade.... The emergence of expert systems has transformed the enterprise of AI." Further, <i>Computerworld</i> reported that, "Recent advances in expert systems are putting society at the brink of a massive application of artificial intelligence."
</p>

<p>
From, roughly, 1970 to 1993, Expert Systems captivated the AI community and public as do today's Recognition Systems. Expert Systems technology was absorbed by the software industry, omnipresent but unnoted in contemporary software.
</p>

<p>
What is the history of Expert Systems, and how does it inform the development of machine learning and neural networks today? Join a panel of former AAAI presidents &mdash; all major contributors to the expert systems story &mdash; for insights and perspectives.

Advances in AI in Poker: Two Mini-Talks on Recent Breakthroughs and a Panel</h3>
<p><b>Moderator: Kevin Leyton-Brown (University of British Columbia, Canada)</b></p>

<p><b>Panelists: Michael Bowling (University of Alberta, Canada) and Tuomas Sandholm
(Carnegie Mellon University, USA)</b></p>

<p>Poker has been a challenge problem in AI and game theory for decades. As a game of imperfect information it involves obstacles not present in classic board games like chess and go, but which are present in many real-world applications, such as negotiation, security, and auctions. However, no programs had beaten professional players in large poker games. Until now! New breakthrough domain-independent advances have seen computer programs surpass human experts in the game of heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em, which has over 10<sup>160</sup> decision points. Michael Bowling (who led the team that beat top poker pros in limit Texas hold'em in 2008) will talk about DeepStack, which late last year defeated a collection of professional poker players in heads-up no-limit. Tuomas Sandholm (who led the team that is the current two-time champion of the Annual Computer Poker Competition in heads-up no-limit) will talk about Libratus, which last month defeated a team of top heads-up no-limit specialist professionals. These two short talks will be followed by a panel discussion. Come learn about the latest scientific breakthroughs and milestones achieved in AI.</p>

Designing Assistive Robots and Technologies for Pediatric Care</h3>
<p><b>Ayanna Howard (Georgia Institute of Technology, USA)</b></p>


<p>In recent months, there has been an upsurge in the attention given to robots and artificial intelligence and their inevitable destruction of the human race if we are not watchful. Whether your opinion sits on one side or the other, the fact remains; robots have already become a part of our society. In particular, with recent advances in robotics, therapeutic interventions using robots is now ideally positioned to make an impact. There are numerous challenges though that must still be addressed. In this talk, Howard will discuss the role of robotics and related technologies for pediatric therapy.  She will present her approaches in which these technologies address real-life therapy goals for children with special needs.</p>
