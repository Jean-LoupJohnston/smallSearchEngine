<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA1">SA1:</a>  </i>Large-Scale NonLinear Classification: Algorithms and Evaluations</h3>
<p><b>Zhuang Wang</b></p>

<p>Most of the research in AI has been directed to the problem of data classification in which the algorithm learns linear/nonlinear models from data. Nonlinear data classification is particularly important as complex nonlinear concepts often occur in the nature. An accurate and scalable algorithm with the ability of learning nonlinear model plays a key role in various data mining, NLP, computer vision, and information retrieval problems. In an environment where new large-scale problems are emerging in various disciplines and pervasive computing applications are becoming common, there is a real need for classification algorithms that are able to process increasing amounts of data efficiently. Recent advances in large-scale learning resulted in many popular algorithms for linear classification using large data. However, technologies for large-scale nonlinear classification are still under developed and the best practices are less known. To fill this gap we present a survey of state of the art algorithms and software packages and the evaluation on benchmark data sets. We discuss algorithms on different aspect of this area in details. We also present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of these algorithms and off-the-shelf software on a collection of the large real-life data sets across various domains. Basic background in supervised learning is assumed.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA2">SA2:</a>  </i>Representing and Reasoning with Qualitative Preferences: Tools and Applications</h3>
<p><b>Ganesh Ram Santhanam, Samik Basu, and Vasant Honavar</b></p>


<p>This tutorial will present the state of the art in the practical aspects of representing and reasoning with qualitative preferences. We will begin with  motivating applications followed by a brief review of qualitative preference representation languages (QPRL) such as CP-nets, TCP-nets and CI-nets. We will introduce the key preference reasoning tasks: dominance testing (checking the dominance of one alternative over another), consistency checking (testing for cyclic induced preferences), ordering (computing a sequence of solutions in descending order of preference), and equivalence and subsumption checking (testing if the set of preferences induced by one agent is (respectively) equal to, or is subset of, the set induced by the other). We will then show how to reduce preference reasoning  to model checking by (a) encoding the semantics of the preference languages into a Kripke structure, and (b) translating reasoning queries into appropriate temporal logic formulas for the Kripke structure. We will  introduce i-PrefR, an open source tool that supports preference reasoning in popular QPRL. The attendees will learn how to specify and reason with preferences using i-PrefR.
</p>

<p>
Prior knowledge of QPRL although beneficial, is not required.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA3">SA3:</a>  </i>SAT in AI: High Performance Search Methods with Applications</h3>
<p><b>Jussi Rintanen</b></p>

<p>Forms of reasoning embodied in SAT and its extensions are fundamental in the constructing and analyzing intelligent systems. The focus of the tutorial is in the algorithmic basis of different SAT variants, as well as their role in efficiently solving a wide range of central problems in AI, from state-space reachability problems such as planning to probabilistic reasoning and machine learning. NP-hard constraint satisfaction and optimization problems arise in most areas of AI, making SAT a reasoning task of a high relevance to a large range of AI researchers. The tutorial is intended for the general AI community audience and only assumes basic knowledge of AI and the propositional logic.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SA4">SA4:</a>  </i>Scaling Machine Learning</h3>
<p><b>Alex Smola and Amr Ahmed</b></p>
<p>
This tutorial discusses machine learning and systems aspects for big data analytics. In particular, we will given an overview of modern distributed processing systems and sources of large amounts of data. We will discuss the parameter server concept in considerable detail and then show how it can be applied to solve a variety of large scale learning problems ranging from Terascale convex optimization, topic modeling on billions of users, generative models for mixed datatypes such as geotagged microblogs, and factorization and recommender systems.</p>

<p>
<i>Systems and Data</i>
</p>
<p>
Data at internet scale does not exist in isolation. That is, it arises as a product of services such as search, advertising, user generated content, rich media content, or location data. This means that data is inherently connected to the form in which it is stored, distributed, and accessible over many machines in a server center. We will give an overview over the following systems:
<i>Hadoop and MapReduce:</i>  Over a decade old, this captures one of the first strategies of solving distributed data processing systems. Emphasis is placed on the ability to process data without too much need for communication, besides episodical exchanges. Despite the simplicity of its API it offers efficient implementation for many batch synchronous data analysis algorithms.
<i>Spark:</i> In many cases moderate amounts of data can be held in distributed memory for processing. This is the key idea in Spark. Efficient machine learning algorithms can be built using this as platform.
<i>Dryad:</i> This is one of the first dataflow and graph processing paradigms.
</p>

<p>
Besides these three tools, a multitude of other systems has sprung up, such as S4, Reef, Storm. It is also useful to consider some prototypical applications in greater detail.
Computational Advertising: One of the core primitives of the digital economy, computational advertising crucially relies on the ability of machine learned systems to estimate accurately the probability of a user interacting with an ad in a meaningful manner. Scalable binary classification arises as a central tool in this context.
<i>Recommendation:</i> In many cases the options available to a user are considerably larger than what is practically feasible. For instance, when recommending movies it is infeasible to offer a choice among tens of thousands of items. Instead, only a small subset is selected for inspection by the user. This situation is analogous in social recommendation, search, and the design of adaptive user interfaces.
<i>Profiling:</i> A key tool in recommendation is the ability to understand a user's desires, preferences, and needs. While elicitation by queries is biased and disruptive for a user, adaptive preference extraction can work behind the scenes using the behavioral trail. Such insight is crucial for accurate recommendation and advertising.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Parameter Server</i></p>
<p>When designing data analysis algorithms, an important challenge is to balance the need of flexibility and generality of machine learning algorithms and the simplicity of systems design. A convenient extension beyond batch-synchronous designs is that of a bipartite graph where clients and servers exchange a partially shared state.

This design, usually referred to as a parameter server has proven successful in scaling to very large problems over the past 5 years. In the tutorial we will discuss a particular variant, as implemented on Parameterserver.org that allows one to scale machine learning systems to hundreds of billions of samples and thousands of machines. It is an open source project hosted at CMU with input from Baidu IDL and and Google. Some of its key features are as follows:
 <i>Efficient communication:</i> All communication is asynchronous. It is optimized for machine learning tasks to reduce network traffic and overhead.
    <i>Flexible consistency models:</i> The system provides flexible consistency models to allow the algorithm designer to balance algorithmic convergence rate and system efficiency, where the best trade-off depends on data, algorithm, and hardware.
    <i>Elastic Scalability:</i> New nodes can be added without restarting the running framework.
   <i> Fault Tolerance and Durability:</i> Recovery from and repair of non-catastraphic machine failures within several seconds, without interrupting computation.
    <i>Ease of Use:</i> The globally shared parameters are represented as (potentially sparse) vectors and matrices to facilitate development of machine learning applications. The linear algebra data types come with high-performance multi-threaded linear algebra libraries.
The tutorial will discuss a number of problems and how they can be mapped into the parameter server framework.
</p>

<p>
<i>Applications</i></p>

<p>To illustrate the use of the tools listed above, we discuss some applications in somewhat greater detail:
    <i>Time-dependent User Profiling:</i> When recommending items to users it is vital to understand what their preferences are and how they might be changing over time. Moreover, it is equally vital to understand whether and how global changes in interest and preference might be affecting individual activity. We give an overview over an integrated model and show how to perform inference at industrial scale using the parameterserver framework.
    <i>Nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise:</i> In many cases a simple flat topic model is inadequate for modeling preferences. For instance, when it comes to capturing location and content of microblogs it is preferable to have the flexibility of capturing multiple areas of location in varying detail. Th same also applies to content preferences (e.g. general photography vs. users of a specific lens system). This requires distributions over trees of topics. We give an overview of the associated generative model and how to perform sampling inference in it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Distributed Optimization</i></p>

<p>A key primitive in solving large scale problems, both for risk minimization and for probabilistic modeling is optimization. Based on two examples we show how this can be achieved efficiently at scale.
   <i> Sparse Logistic Regression:</i> This is one of the simplest cases of nontrivial optimization. It is one of the key drivers to many computational advertising platforms, since compact models immediately translate into higher throughput, hence they are highly desirable. We show how this can be implemented efficiently using a parameter server on half a petabyte of data.
    <i>Distributed Stochastic Variational Inference:</i> For probabilistic modeling matters are slightly less trivial since the problem is typically nonconvex, gradients are stochastic, and distributed initialization is challenging. By combining fast samplers, and adaptive stepsize dynamics we show how this can be accomplished on over 4 billion user profiles.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SP1">SP1:</a>  </i>A Concise Introduction to Planning Models and Methods</h3>
<p><b>Hector Geffner and Blai Bonet</b></p>

<p>Planning is one of the oldest areas in AI, and yet it has changed a great deal over the years, becoming both more mathematical and more empirical. Planning is best conceived as the model-based  approach to autonomous behavior  where the agent behavior is derived automatically from a model. In this sense, planning contrasts with model-free approaches, where the agent behavior results from learning, and programming-based approaches, where the agent behavior is hardwired. The basic  planning models assume complete state information, deterministic actions, and hard goals, yet other models relax these assumptions. All the models are intractable in the worst case, and hence one of  main challenges in planning is  computational: how to scale  up to large models represented in compact form.
</p>

<p>
In the tutorial, we will  look at the variety of models used in AI planning, and the techniques that have been developed for solving them. The goal is to provide a modern and coherent view of planning that is comprehensive but not shallow. It is addressed to researchers and students interested in autonomous behavior and cognitive science. It assumes  a basic knowledge  of math and algorithms, and follows our recent book, <i>A Concise Introduction to Models and Methods for Automated Planning,</i> Morgan and Claypool, 2013.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SP3">SP3:</a>  </i>Game Theory for Security</h3>
<p><b>Bo An, Manish Jain, and Albert Jiang</b></p>

<p>Game theory is an increasingly important paradigm for modeling security games and decision-making in these domains, including homeland security resource allocation decisions, robot patrolling strategies, and computer network security. Several deployed real-world systems use game theory to randomize critical security decisions to prevent terrorists and criminals from exploiting a predictable security schedule. The ARMOR system has been deployed at the Los Angeles International Airport since 2007 and the IRIS system has been deployed by the Federal Air Marshals Service since 2009. PROTECT has been deployed in the port of Boston since April 2011, has been in use at the port of New York since February 2012, and is headed for nationwide deployment; TRUSTS is being evaluated for deterring fare evasion, suppressing urban crime and counter-terrorism within the Los Angeles Metro System, and GUARDS was earlier tested by the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for security inside the airport.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial will introduce a wide variety of game-theoretic modeling techniques and algorithms that have been developed in recent years for security problems. Introductory material on game theory and mathematical programming (optimization) will be included in the tutorial, so there is no prerequisite knowledge for participants. After introducing the basic security game framework, we will describe algorithms for scaling to very large games, methods for modeling uncertainty and attacker observation capabilities in security games, and applications of these techniques for randomized resource allocation and patrolling problems. We will then talk about progress in the recent research area of game theory and human behavior, which deals with developing algorithms that perform well against human opponents.
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of the tutorial we will highlight the many opportunities for future work in this area, including exciting new domains and fundamental theoretical and algorithmic challenges.
</p>

<p>
Our primary target audience is students and other novices who will benefit from an extensive introduction to one of the most important areas of applied multiagent systems research. This tutorial should also be of interest to researchers in the topic of human behavior, since we describe the application of concepts from behavioral game theory. We also anticipate that this tutorial will appeal to industry participants interested in applied work, and to game theory practitioners who may be interested in learning more about the specific techniques employed in this important class of games.
</p>

<p>
The primary tools the audience can learn are game theoretic models for security scenarios and exact/approximate algorithms to find solutions. The audience will also learn how concepts from behavioral game-theory have been applied and deployed in the context of security games. Although it is not the primary objective of the tutorial, attendees can learn also basic groundings on game theory and algorithmic game theory.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="SP4">SP4:</a>  </i>Programming by Optimization: A Practical Paradigm for Computer-Aided Algorithm Design</h3>
<p><b>Holger H Hoos and Frank Hutter</b></p>

<p>When creating software, particularly solvers for the computationally challenging problems arising in many areas of AI, developers frequently explore multiple ways of achieving certain tasks. Often, these alternatives are eliminated or abandoned early in the process. Programming by Optimization (PbO) aims to avoid such premature design choices and to actively develop promising alternatives for parts of the design. The resulting design spaces are explored using powerful optimization techniques to automatically generate programs that perform well in a given use context. As a result, PbO allows human experts to focus on the creative task of imagining possible mechanisms for solving given problems or subproblems, while the tedious job of determining what works best in a given use context is performed automatically, substituting human labor with computation.
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial, we describe the PbO paradigm and the automated algorithm configuration and selection techniques that enable it and demonstrate how PbO enables dramatic performance gains on many AI problems, including SAT, planning, classification and regression tasks. Our presentation is aimed at AI researchers interested in using the PbO approach and the practical tools that support it to better realize the performance potential inherent in their algorithmic ideas; it does not assume any specialized background knowledge.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="MA1">MA1 (FULL DAY):</a>  </i>From Deep Blue to Monte Carlo: An Update on Game Tree Research</h3>
<p><b>Akihiro Kishimoto and Martin Mueller</b></p>

<p>Research in board games has made great strides since the classic win of IBM's Deep Blue over Kasparov, and since checkers was solved by Schaeffer et al. This half day long tutorial presents an up to date overview of research techniques for classical two player games. Some of the questions we will discuss are: How did game tree search develop since Deep Blue? What are the ideas behind current methods and which successes have they achieved in games and elsewhere? What are the biggest open problems in games research?
</p>

<p>
The tutorial reviews the most important game-tree search techniques developed over the last half century, starting with traditional methods such as minimax and alphabeta, and leads up to state of the art methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Proof-Number Search. The tutorial includes an application overview which showcases the use of the presented techniques in a large variety of games, as well as in topics as diverse as AI planning, mixed integer programming, biometrics security authentication, physics simulations and organic chemical synthesis.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial assumes only general undergraduate level AI knowledge. It is suited for graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as for a general AI audience who wants to refresh and update their knowledge of the subject.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="MA2">MA2:</a>  </i>Latent Tree Models</h3>
<p><b>Nevin L. Zhang</b></p>

<p>Latent tree models (LTMs) are tree-structured probabilistic graphical models where the variables at leaf nodes are observed while those at internal nodes are latent. They represent complex relationships among observed variables and yet are computationally simple to work with. When used for data analysis, they divide observed variables into groups such that the correlations among variables in each group are properly modeled by a single latent variable. As such, LTMs are an effective tool for detecting co-occurrence patterns in binary data and correlation patterns in general data. An LTM typically contains multiple latent variables and each latent variable represents a soft partition of data. As such, LTMs are also a novel tool for clustering that produces multiple partitions of data.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial will start with the definition of latent tree models and a discussion on their relationships with finite mixture models and phylogenetic trees. Several theoretical considerations will then be addressed. After that, various algorithms for learning LTMs will be surveyed. Finally, application examples will be presented to demonstrate the use of LTMs for co-occurrence pattern detection, latent variable discovery, multidimensional clustering, topic detection and general probabilistic modeling. This tutorial is targeted at researchers who have basic knowledge of probabilistic graphical models.

<p><b>Fabian Hadiji, Hung Hai Bui, Kristian Kersting, Martin Mladenov, and Sriraam Natarajan</b></p>

<p>Graphical models often contain symmetries. Prominent examples are graphical models obtained by grounding relational probabilistic models. Relational probabilistic models subsume many different languages and approaches combining probabilities and logic. Although relational models have the potential to scale AI to the next level, inference in these models is a challenging problem due to the large complexity of the models. Hence, one typically has to resort to approximation algorithms. To scale even further, exploiting symmetries during inference in the models has attracted a lot attention recently in the statistical relational learning and probabilistic inference community. This line of work, which we refer to as "lifted approximate inference", has produced many promising practical and interesting theoretical results. However, lifting different kind of approximate inference algorithms requires different mathematical definitions of symmetry, and therefore, different algorithms to find these symmetries. Our proposed tutorial aims to give a unified and coherent view of different lifted approximate inference techniques, their underlying symmetries, and the associated symmetry discovery algorithms. This is the first tutorial on approximate lifted inference, covering the ideas mentioned above and giving a detailed introduction on algorithmic methods as well as the underlying mathematical theory.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="MA4">MA4:</a>  </i>Planning in Hybrid Domains</h3>
<p><b>Maria Fox and Daniele Magazzeni</b></p>

<p>Hybrid systems are systems with both continuous control variables and discrete logical modes. Many interesting real problems give rise to hybrid systems, including mission planning for autonomous vehicles, smart power management, satellite observation planning and disaster recovery. 
</p>
 
<p>
Planning in these domains requires rich models to capture the interaction between discrete and continuous change, and methods for reasoning with temporal, spatial and continuous constraints.
</p>
 
<p>
The tutorial starts with an introduction to modelling hybrid systems as Planning problems. Two approaches that are current in the literature are considered: the Domain Predictive Control approach of Lohr, Eyerich, Keller and Nebel, and the hybrid planning methods of Coles, Coles, Fox and Long and of Della Penna, Intrigila, Magazzeni and Mercorio. The tutorial then considers the relationship between planning and the hybrid system model-checking approaches of Cimatti, Mover and Tonetta, and of Bogomolov, Podelski, Wehrle et al., showing how mappings can be defined between the mixed discrete-continuous planning domain description language, PDDL+, and model-checking formalisms such as HyTech, HyDi, and SpaceEx. The concept of model-checking as planning is then discussed. An overview of techniques for planning in hybrid domains is provided. Finally, some recent challenging case studies are presented and open problems are discussed.
</p>
 
<p>
The target is the broad audience of AAAI-14, as the tutorial covers multidisciplinary topics, relevant to planning, machine learning, robotics, etc., with a proper mix of theory and applications.
</p>
 
<p>
Students are very welcome. A basic familiarity with AI planning and model-checking is assumed.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="MP1">MP1:</a>  </i>Bayesian Mechanism Design</h3>
<p><b>Jason Hartline</b></p>

<p>This tutorial surveys the classical economic theory of Bayesian mechanism design and recent advances from the perspective of algorithms and approximation. Classical economics gives simple characterizations of Bayes-Nash equilibrium and optimal mechanisms when the agents' preferences are linear and single-dimensional. The mechanisms it predicts are often complex and overly dependent on details of the model. Approximation complements this theory and suggests that simple and less-detail-dependent mechanisms can be nearly optimal. Furthermore, techniques from approximation and algorithms can be used to describe good mechanisms beyond the single-dimensional, linear model of agent preferences.
</p>

Optimal behavior and outcomes in complex environments are complex and, therefore, should not be expected; instead, the theory of approximation can show that simple and natural behaviors are approximately optimal in complex environments. This approach is applied to auction theory and mechanism design in his graduate textbook Mechanism Design and Approximation which is under preparation.
