Intelligent Interaction with the Real World</h3>
<p><b>Leslie Pack Kaelbling (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</b></p>

<p>Since the inception of the field, one of the visions of artificial intelligence has been robust, intelligent, general-purpose robots that interact with the real world.  We have made useful progress in that direction, but there is still a long way to go.  I will characterize one view of how we might achieve this goal, describe some intermediate results, and characterize important technical and methodological problems that must be solved to make that vision real.</p>

Challenges for AI in Computational Sustainability
</h3>
<p><b>Carla P. Gomes (Cornell University)</b></p>

<p>Computational Sustainability is a new interdisciplinary research field with the overall goal of developing computational models, methods, and tools to help manage the balance between environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future. In this talk I will provide an overview of Computational Sustainability, with examples ranging from wildlife conservation and biodiversity, to poverty mitigation, to large-scale deployment and management of renewable energy sources. I will highlight overarching computational challenges for AI at the intersection of constraint reasoning, optimization, machine learning, and dynamical systems. Finally I will discuss the need for a new approach that views computational sustainability problems as "natural" phenomena, amenable to a scientific methodology, in which principled experimentation, to explore problem parameter spaces and hidden problem structure, plays as prominent a role as formal analysis.</p>

Constraint Programming and Artificial Intelligence: Challenges, Applications and Opportunities
</h3>
<p><b>Barry O'Sullivan (University College Cork)</b></p><p>Constraint programming is a powerful tool for modeling and solving complex optimization problems. It is widely used to support industrial decision-making, as well as being used as a component in various intelligent systems. Constraint programming has its origins in constraint satisfaction and logic programming from the field of artificial intelligence, and mathematical programming from the field of operations research. In this talk I will: identify some of the challenges facing the field; present some exciting applications of constraint programming; and give a view of where opportunities lie for the future from the perspectives of both science and application.</p>

Incentive Engineering in the Internet Age
</h3>
<p><b>David C. Parkes (Harvard University)</b></p>

<p>Mechanism design provides a formalism within which to understand the possible and the impossible when designing multi-agent systems with private information and rational agents. In introducing computational considerations, we have gained some understanding of how to reconcile new tensions that arise. Today, we see a thirst for practical, engineered incentive mechanisms to deploy across the myriad of multiuser systems enabled by the Internet. I will highlight some of the new challenges that this presents, in moving from isolated events to continual processes, from simple models to complex, multifaceted agent models, and in enabling new kinds of computational and coordination processes.</p>

Systems with General Intelligence: A New Perspective
</h3>
<p><b>Michael Thielscher (The University of New South Wales)</b></p>


<p>General intelligence enables agents and robots to adapt automatically to previously unknown situations. This new level of autonomy has recently been achieved in Computer Game Playing with the advent of programs that understand the rules of new games and learn to play them well without human intervention. This talk will advocate agents and robots with general intelligence as a Grand Challenge, aiming at the next generation of AI systems that can be told what we expect from them and that learn to carry out radically different tasks in radically new environments. It will be argued that this calls for a new research focus for AI with the goal to integrate different, successful AI methodologies.</p>

Cancer: A Computational Disease that AI Can Cure</h3>
<p><b>Jay M. Tenenbaum (CollabRx Inc.)</b></p>

<p>Cancer results from finite genomic mutations that biotechnology can easily list, and that we can mostly understand and reason about in terms of the underlying biochemistry. Tragically, the scientific and medical communities are searching for cures using an incredibly inefficient non-adaptive strategy, where the costs of experiments are measured in lives, as well as money, and where we capture only a small portion of the genomics and outcomes data, i.e., in clinical trials. Inspired by my career experiences as an AI researcher, Internet entrepreneur and cancer survivor, I am attempting to redress this situation through Cancer Commons, a "rapid learning" community of patients, physicians and researchers. Our goal is to cure cancer by collecting the genomic and response data from thousands of adaptively-planned individual treatment experiments, integrating the resulting sparse fragments of evidence to infer the true causal mechanisms of tumors and drugs, and generalizing the resulting knowledge so that it can be applied to new cases. Each patient is treated in accord with the best available knowledge, and that knowledge is continually updated to benefit the next patient. Hopefully, this adaptive approach will efficiently climb the hill to find cures for cancer, one patient at a time.</p>

A New Paradigm of Geriatric Care Empowered by Applied AI</h3>
<p><b>Majd Alwan (Center for Aging Services Technologies)</b></p>


<p>Advances in sensor, communication, artificial intelligence technologies and data processing, coupled the increasing processing power, is causing a shift in the way we care for the elderly. This paper presents a new paradigm for geriatric care based on monitoring and assisting older adults in their own living settings. AI techniques could be applied to mine health and activity data collected in the home to detect indicators of early disease onset, deterioration or improvement, inform providers and allow the delivery of care services, including assistance and support. Examples of monitoring and assistive systems that apply AI techniques are discussed. The approach has significant value to older adults as well as caregivers, and allows care providers to extend services into the community.</p>

Species of Mind</h3>
<p><b>Vernor Vinge (San Diego State University)</b></p>

<p>More than any other animal, we humans invent ways to outsource cognitive function. We've been doing this for a long time. For instance, writing is an outsourcing of memory; money is a scalar that allows the comparison of vastly different objects.</p>

<p>During the last century, the outsourcing process has become more diverse and intense. The range of our recent activities is leading toward a number of "different kinds" of superhuman intelligence.</p>

<p>In this presentation, I'll discuss several different paths to superintelligence, their relative power, the transformations they might create, and how humans might deal with them.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/IAAI/2010/Photos/vinge.jpg" alt="Vernor Vinge" width="59" height="75" class="img1" /><b><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html" rel="nofollow">Vernor Vinge</a></b> is a science-fiction writer, winner of five Hugo Awards. He holds a PhD (mathematics) from University of California, San Diego and taught mathematics and computer science at San Diego State University from 1972 to 2000. In 1982, at a panel for AAAI-82, he proposed that technology would accelerate the evolution of intelligence, leading to a kind of "singularity" beyond which merely human extrapolation was essentially impossible. In the 1980s and 1990s, he elaborated on this theme in both his science fiction and nonfiction writing.</p>
