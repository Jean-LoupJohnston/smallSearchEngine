Lee is director of the World Wide Web Consortium. Invited talks were  delivered by Karen Myers (SRI International), Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Pedro Domingos (University of Washington), and Ken Koedinger (Carnegie Mellon University). The Robert S. Engelmore Memorial Lecture was delivered by Bruce G. Buchanan. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06speakers.php">Details . . .</a></p><h4>New for 2006!</h4><p><b>Senior Members Track</b><br />New this year, senior members of AAAI had an opportunity to give a broad talk on a well-developed body of research, an important new research area, or a thoughtful critique of trends in the field. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06senior.php">Details ...</a></p><p><b>AAAI Member Posters!</b><br />The goal of this novel program was to provide a forum in which AAAI members can present and discuss their work based on a submitted abstract, rather than a regular AAAI paper. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06members.php">Details ...</a></p><p><b>AAAI Nectar!</b><br />AAAI conference attendees had an opportunity to learn about results from AAAI&rsquo;s sister conferences, in a new special paper track designed to highlight those results in a way that is accessible to a broad audience. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06nectar.php">Details ...</a></p><p><b>Two Special Technical Tracks!</b><br />For the first time, AAAI-06 had special technical tracks: one on <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06iictrack.php">integrated intelligent capabilities</a>  (inviting papers that report on theoretical or empirical studies that highlight the role of integration of multiple components in achieving intelligent behavior),and the other on <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06webtrack.php">artificial intelligence and the web</a> (inviting technical papers on the use of AI techniques, systems and conceptsinvolving the Web). </p><hr /><h4>AAAI-06 Offered a Broad Range of Programs for <i>all</i> AI Practitioners and Researchers</h4><p><b>For AAAI Members: Member Posters and Senior Member Papers</b></p><ul><li>Senior AAAI members gave broad talks on an area of AI. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06senior.php">Details ...</a></li><li>AAAI members presented posters based on their work. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06members.php">Details ...</a></li></ul><p><b>For the AI Researcher: The Technical Program and IAAI</b></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06nectar.php">Nectar Papers</a></li><li>The Technical Program formed the core of AAAI-06.

Fluxplayer won the competition with a score of 2690.75, beating out second-place finisher and defending champion Cluneplayer of UCLA (which finished with 25.73.75 points) by 117 points. Greg Kuhlmann&rsquo;s and Peter Stone&rsquo;s UT-Austin-Larg finished third with 2370.50 points. The AAAI competition was designed to test the abilitiesof general game playing systems by comparing their performance on a variety of games. The competition consisted of two phases: a qualification round and a runoff competition.</p><p><b>The AAAI Mobile Robot Competition Demonstrated Cutting Edge in Robotics</b><br />Now in its fifteenth year, the Mobile Robot Competition for 2006 included the Robot Challenge, the Human Robot Interaction, the Scavenger Hunt, the Robot Exhibition, and the Mobile Robot Workshop.  The AAAI-06 Mobile Robot Competition celebrated AI&rsquo;s 50th anniversary with a scavenger hunt, where robots hunted for objects like a stuffed Winnie the Pooh. Winning the Scavenger Hunt this year was Kansas State University&rsquo;s Willie, which used sonar to find ojects inside an area it had previously mapped. Other award-winners included Idaho National Labs (Judges&rsquo; Choice Award for Outstanding Human/Robot Interface) and UCLA (Judges&rsquo; Choice Award for Outstanding Adaptation of Current Research). 	In the Human Robot Interaction competition, Universit&eacute; de Sherbrooke swept the award categories, winning the Judges&rsquo; and Audience Favorite categories as well as being the overall winner of the competition.Details on the participants are available on page 18 of the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06program.pdf">program.</a> Additional information is available on the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06robots.php">Robot</a> pages. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06robotcall.pdf">A Call for Participation</a> is also available.</p><p><b>Last-Minute Addition: AAAI Computer Poker Competition</b><br />AAAI-06 held the first AAAI Computer Poker Competition. The University of Alberta&rsquo;s Hyperborean won. The bot from Edmonton defeated four other competing bots, including bots from Carnegie Mellon  and Monash Universities as well as two privately designed bots to take first place in the Bankroll (0.3925 small bets per hand) and Series Competitions (3wins, 0 losses).	BluffBot, the second place finisher, took second in the Bankroll competition (0.0954 small bets per hand) as well as the Series competition (2 wins, 1 loss).	Third place in the Bankroll Competition went to Monash BPP (Monash University, Australia). Third Place in the series competition went to GS2 from Carnegie Mellon University, with 1 win, and 2 losses.</p><hr /><h4>AAAI-06 Exhibits Showcased Research in Action, and in Print!</h4><p><b>The AAAI Mobile Robot Exhibition Demonstrated State of the Art Robotics Research</b><br />The mission of the robot exhibition was to demonstrate state of the art research in a less structured environment than the competition events. The exhibition gave researchers an opportunity to showcase current robotics and embodied-AI research that did not fit into the competition tasks. In additionto research, exhibits that demonstrated how robotics can be used to enhance education in AI and other related courses were highly encouraged. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06robots.php#exhibition">Details ...</a></p><p><b>AAAI Intelligent Systems Demonstrations Showcased AI Implementations and Showed Research in Action </b><br /><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/Photos/isdemo.jpg" width="150" height="98" alt="AAAI-05 IS Demo Booth" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;" />The IS Demos program showcased state-of-the-art AI implementations and provided AI researchers with an opportunity to show their research in action. Implemented intelligent systems allowed us not only to experimentally validate AI research, but also to make AI research accessible to each other, to the broader scientific community, and to the public at large. The list of demonstrations presented at AAAI-06 can be found in the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/../Library/AAAI/aaai06contents.php#demos">AAAI-06 proceedings.</a> Additional details are available on page 17 of the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06program.pdf">program.</a></p><p><b>AAAI-06 Exhibitors Showcase State of the Art AI Products and Books</b><br />AAAI-06 exhibitors included AAAI Press, BAE Systems, Cambridge University Press, Elsevier/Morgan Kaufmann, Googe, ITA Software, Inc., K/Team / RoadNarrows, Microsoft, The MIT Press, Mobile Robots, Inc., Springer, and Yahoo! Research. Descriptions are available on page 16 of the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06program.pdf">program.</a> </p><h4>Boston Venue Highlights</h4><p>The historic city of Boston, Massachusetts, on the eastern seaboard of the United States, was a great venue for AAAI-06. Aside from MIT, Harvard, and a number of other nearby colleges and universities with strong AI departments, there was always something happening in this fascinating city.</p><p>AAAI-06 was held at the Seaport Hotel.</p><h4>Collocated Events</h4><p>The following events were collocated with AAAI-06:</p><ul>	<li>Fifth Americas School on Agents and Multiagent Systems<br />	Harvard University<br />	July 14&ndash;17, 2006</li>	<li>UAI-2006: 22nd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial IntelligenceMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA<br />July 13-16, 2006</li><li>The Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence: The Next Fifty Years<br />	Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire<br />	July 13-15, 2006</li></ul><h4>Acknowledgements</h4><p>AAAI thanks all the hard-working members of the <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2006/aaai06committee.php">organizing and program committee </a>for their efforts in making AAAI-06 in Boston a success.</p></div></div></div><div id="left">
