Revisiting the Dream</h3>
<p><b>Henry Kautz (University of Rochester)</b><br />

Tuesday, July 24<br />
9:00 &ndash; 10:00 AM</p>

<p>For much of its history, the field of AI has been in retreat from the most ambitious goals of its founders. Rather than attempting to understand and replicate general intelligence, research concentrated on smaller, better-defined perceptual and reasoning tasks over limited domains. We are now at a point, however, where the subfields are coming together again, and the idea of achieving the old dream of AI is no longer fanciful. We are entering an age of computerized personal servants, self-driving vehicles, the universal natural language translator, and the solution to the mysteries of the brain. The merging of human and machine intelligence will drive progress on problems across science, industry, and education. I will recap some of the transformative events we have witnessed over the past few years, and describe a vision of the near future that is both realistic and more wildly optimistic than most serious scientists would have dared imagine a decade ago.</p>

The Mechanization of Causal Inference: A "Mini Turing Test" and Beyond</h3>
<p><b>Judea Pearl (University of California, Los Angeles)</b>
<br />
<i>(Open to all registrants and ACM members)</i><br />
Tuesday, July 24<br />
10:20 &ndash; 11:20 AM</p>

<p>Judea Pearl, professor of computer science at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, was recently named the recipient of the 2011 
ACM A. M. Turing Award for fundamental contributions to artificial 
intelligence through the development of a calculus for probabilistic 
and causal reasoning. Pearl has chosen AAAI-12 as the venue 
to deliver his Turing Award Lecture. This lecture is open to all 
conference participants and ACM members.</p>

<p>Judea Pearl will review concepts, principles, and mathematical 
tools that were found useful in applications involving causal and 
counterfactual reasoning. This semantical framework gives rise to a 
coherent and friendly calculus that unifies several approaches to 
causation and resolves long-standing problems in the empirical 
sciences. The mechanization of counterfactual reasoning amounts to 
passing a mini "Turing test" in causal conversations. Its application 
in the empirical sciences unveils several opportunities and 
limitations of the "big-data" enterprise.</p>

<p><b>Christos H. Papadimitriou (University of California, Berkeley)</b>
<br />
Wednesday, July 25<br />
9:00&ndash;10:00 AM</p>

<p>Turing, like Darwin, transformed scientific and human culture through a singularly disruptive work written in a brilliantly self-conscious style. I shall recount the stories of these two classics, concluding with certain unexpected connections between computational ideas and evolution.</p>

Learning to Behave by Reading</h3>
<p><b>Regina Barzilay (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</b>
<br />
Thursday, July 26<br />
9:00&ndash;10:00 AM</p>

<p>In this talk, I will address the problem of grounding linguistic 
analysis in control applications, such as game playing and robot 
navigation. We assume access to natural language documents that 
describe the desired behavior of a control algorithm (such as game 
strategy guides). Our goal is to demonstrate that knowledge 
automatically extracted from such documents can dramatically improve 
performance of the target application. First, I will present a 
reinforcement learning algorithm for learning to map natural language 
instructions to executable actions. This technique has enabled 
automation of tasks that until now have required human participation 
&mdash; for example, automatically configuring software by consulting 
how-to guides. Next, I will present a Monte-Carlo search algorithm 
for game playing that incorporates information from game strategy 
guides. In this framework, the task of text interpretation is 
formulated as a probabilistic model that is trained based on feedback 
from Monte-Carlo search. When applied to the Civilization strategy 
game, a language-empowered player outperforms its traditional 
counterpart by a significant margin.</p>

Automating Biology Using Robot Scientists</h3>
<p><b>Ross D. King (University of Manchester, UK)</b>
<br />
Wednesday, July 25<br />
1:25&ndash;2:25 PM</p>


<p>A robot scientist is a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to execute cycles of automated scientific experimentation. A Robot Scientist can automatically execute cycles of: hypothesis formation, selection of efficient experiments to discriminate between hypotheses, execution of experiments using laboratory automation equipment, and analysis of results. We developed the robot scientist <i>Adam</i> to investigate yeast functional genomics. Adam is the first time a machine has discovered novel scientific knowledge. This knowledge is described in a formal argument involving over 10,000 different research units that relates Adam's 6.6 million observations to its conclusions. Our new robot scientist <i>Eve</i> applies the same approach to drug design. Eve has efficiently found "lead compounds" for malaria and other neglected tropical diseases.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2012/Photos/king.jpg" alt="Ross King" width="75" height="75" class="img1" /><b>Ross King's</b> first degree was in microbiology, and then he switched to computer science, and has been interested in the intersection of these disciplines ever since. His Ph.D. was done on machine learning for bioinformatics in the late 1980s at the Turing Institute in Scotland. This was led by the AI pioneer Donald Michie, and was the best place he has ever worked. In his career he has worked in a statistics department, a startup-company, a structural biology lab, and computer science departments. Unusually, he ran both a "wet" biology laboratory (with his robots), and a computer science lab. In his view science is an excellent application domain for AI research, and AI can have a real impact on making the practice of science more efficient. The physics Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek is on record as stating that the best physicist in 100 years time may be a machine; King is working towards this vision.</p>

How to Grow a Mind: Statistics, Structure and Abstraction</h3>
<p><b>Joshua B. Tenenbaum (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</b>
<br />
Thursday, July 26<br />
1:25&ndash;2:25 PM</p>

<p>The fields of cognitive science and artificial intelligence grew up together, with the twin goals of understanding human minds and making machines smarter in more humanlike ways. Yet since the 1980s they have mostly grown apart, as cognitive scientists came to see AI as too focused on applications and technical engineering issues rather than big questions of intelligence, while AI researchers came to see cognitive science as too informal and concerned with peculiarities of human minds and brains rather than general principles. Just in the last few years, however, these fields appear poised to reconverge in exciting and deep ways. Cognitive scientists have begun to adopt the toolkit of modern probabilistic AI as a unifying framework for modeling natural intelligence, while many AI researchers are looking beyond immediate applications to some of the big picture questions that originally motivated the field, and both communities are increasingly aware of and even informed by the other's moves in these directions.</p>

<p>This talk will describe recent work at the center of the convergence: computational accounts of human intelligence that both draw on and advance state-of-the-art AI. I will focus on capacities for which even young children still far surpass machines: learning from very few examples, and common sense reasoning about the physical and social world. These abilities can be explained as approximate forms of probabilistic (Bayesian) inference over richly structured models &mdash; probabilistic models built on top of knowledge representations familiar from earlier, classic AI days, such as graphs, grammars, schemas, predicate logic, and functional programs. In many cases, sampling-based approximate inference with these models can be surprisingly tractable and can predict human judgments with high quantitative accuracy. Extended in a hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian framework, these models can explain how children learn to learn, bootstrapping adult-like intelligence from more primitive foundations. Using probabilistic programming languages, these models can be integrated into a unified cognitive architecture. Throughout the talk I will present concrete examples, along with a few more speculative predictions, of how these cognitive modeling efforts can inform the development of more intelligent machine systems.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2012/Photos/tenenbaum.jpg" alt=" Josh Tenenbaum" width="60" height="75" class="img1" /><b> Josh Tenenbaum</b> studies learning, reasoning and perception in humans and machines, with the twin goals of understanding human intelligence in computational terms and bringing computers closer to human capacities. His current work focuses on building probabilistic models to explain how people come to be able to learn new concepts from very sparse data, how we learn to learn, and the nature and origins of people's intuitive theories about the physical and social worlds. He is Professor of Computational Cognitive Science in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, and is a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 1999, and was a member of the Stanford University faculty in Psychology and (by courtesy) Computer Science from 1999 to 2002.

Duolingo: Translating the Web with Millions of People</h3>
<p><b>Luis von Ahn (Carnegie Mellon University)</b>
<br />
Tuesday, July 24<br />
1:25&ndash;2:25 PM</p>


<p>I want to translate the web into every major language: every web page, every video, and, yes, even Justin Bieber's tweets. With its content split up into hundreds of languages  &mdash;  and with over 50 percent of it in English  &mdash;  most of the web is inaccessible to most people in the world. This problem is pressing, now more than ever, with millions of people from China, Russia, Latin America and other quickly developing regions entering the web. In this talk, I introduce my new project, called <i>Duolingo,</i> which aims at breaking the language barrier, and thus making the web truly world wide.</p>

<p>We have all seen how systems such as Google Translate are improving every day at translating the gist of things written in other languages. Unfortunately, they are not yet accurate enough for my purpose: Even when what they spit out is intelligible, it's so badly written that I can't read more than a few lines before getting a headache. This is why you don't see machine-translated books. With Duolingo, our goal is to encourage people, like you and me, to translate the web into their native languages.</p>

Building AI: Our Shared Enterpise</h3>
<p><b>Steven Minton (President, InferLink Corporation)</b>
<br />
Wednesday, July 25<br />
10:20&ndash;11:20 AM</p>

<p>The past few decades have seen great progress in AI. Most of this progress has resulted from contributions made by teams of scientists and engineers building on the earlier contributions of other teams, rather than from individual "breakthroughs". Ultimately, this is made possible because we share our methods and results. There are many mechanisms that help us build upon previous work, from traditional scholarly journals and conferences, to open source software, to data repositories. In fact, the development of the internet has facilitated new and exciting ways to build communities and to jointly contribute to the development of AI. This talk will discuss new and evolving models for scientific collaboration, approaches for funding nonprofit enterprises, and innovative ways that we can all contribute to the development of AI.

ml-class.org: Teaching Machine Learning to 100,000 Students</h3>
<p><b>Andrew Ng (Stanford University and Coursera)</b>
<br />
Monday, July 23<br />
9:30&ndash;10:30 AM</p

<p>Last year, Stanford University offered three online courses, which anyone in the world could enroll in and take for free. Students were expected to submit homeworks, meet deadlines, and were awarded a "Statement of Accomplishment" only if they met our high grading bar. Offered this way, my machine learning class had over 100,000 enrolled students. To put this number in context, in order to reach an audience of this size, I would have had to teach my normal Stanford class (enrollment of ~400) for 250 years.</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll report on the outcome of this bold experiment in distributed education. I'll also describe my experience teaching one of these classes, and leading the development of the platform used to teach two of the classes. I'll describe the key technology and pedagogy ideas used to offer these courses, ranging from easy-to-create video chunks, to a scalable online question and answer forum where students can get their questions answered quickly, to sophisticated autograded homeworks. Importantly, using a "flipped classroom" model, we also used these resources to improve the education of the enrolled, on-campus, Stanford students as well.</p>

<p>Whereas technology and automation have made almost all segments of our economy &mdash; such agriculture, energy, manufacturing, transportation &mdash; vastly more efficient, education today isn't much different than it was 300 years ago. Given also the rising costs of higher education, the hyper-competitive nature of college admissions, and the lack of access to a high quality education, I think there is a huge opportunity to use modern internet and AI technology to inexpensively offer a high quality education online. Through such technology, we envision millions of people gaining access to the world-leading education that has so far been available only to a tiny few, and using this education to improve their lives, the lives of their families, and the communities they live in. Following the success of the first set of courses, there are now 14 planned courses for Winter quarter (offered by instructors from the University of Michigan, the University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford), and we hope to grow this effort further over time.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2012/Photos/ng.jpg" alt="Andrew Ng" width="72" height="75" class="img1" /><b>Andrew Ng</b> received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, and is now an Associate professor of computer science at Stanford University, where he works on machine learning and AI. He is also director of the Stanford AI Lab, which is home to about 12 professors and 150 PhD students and post docs. His previous work includes autonomous helicopters, the Stanford AI Robot (STAIR) project, and ROS (probably the most widely used open-source robotics software platform today). He current work focuses on neuroscience-informed deep learning and unsupervised feature learning algorithms. His group has won best paper or best student paper awards at ICML, ACL, CEAS, 3DRR.
