<h4><a name="sa1">SA1:</a> Agentpalooza: Rapid Creation and Deployment of Embodied Conversational Agents</h4>
<p><b>Andrew M. Olney, Patrick Hays, and Whitney L. Cade</b><br />

<p>Embodied conversational agents are virtual characters that engage users in conversation with appropriate speech, gesture, and facial expression. The high cost of developing embodied conversational agents has led to a recent increase in open-source agent platforms. In this tutorial, we present a framework for the rapid creation and deployment of embodied conversational agents. The tutorial will introduce novices to the basic concepts involved in creating ECAs. The tutorial will further describe a content creation pipeline that allows users to use a mixture of low cost and free tools to create customized virtual humans, animate them using motion capture, and deploy them as intelligent interfaces via the XNA Framework. The material covered in the tutorial is suitable both as a starting point for the development of a more advanced system or as a teaching tool for AI curricula.</p>

<p>The tutorial will include (1) an introduction to embodied conversational agents (2) an overview of common 3D art and animation technologies; (3) a simple content creation pipeline for ECAs; (4)a simple motion capture pipeline for animating ECAs; and (5) integrating ECAs into intelligent interfaces.</p>

<p>The tutorial requires no prerequisite knowledge for ECA creation. However, for integration with an intelligent interface, some familiarity with Visual Studio will be useful.</p>

<h4><a name="sa2">SA2:</a> Trading Agents</h4>
<p><b>Michael Wellman and Amy Greenwald</b></p>

<p>Bidding in electronic markets is pervasive throughout the modern economy, from finance (equity, currency, and commodity markets), to electronic commerce (Amazon, eBay, and others), to supply chains (B2B marketplaces), to Internet advertising (search and display ad exchanges). The tutorial frames and motivates the problem of developing automated trading strategies for such markets. We use illustrative examples from several application domains to motivate the problems, which we then address at the more abstract level of generic auction environments, which can be seen as canonical trading games. We survey the state-of-the-art in analyzing strategies for basic market games, and introduce complex market scenarios beyond current theoretical understanding. To deal with such rich applications, we present a general methodology (empirical and game-theoretic) for trading agent design and analysis.</p>

<p>The tutorial is designed for those interested in trading domains as an application area for AI methods, for either research or practice. It will be broadly accessible to an AI audience. Exposure to basic concepts of game theory (such as Nash equilibrium) and auction theory (such as revenue equivalence) is helpful, but not assumed.</p>

<p>Please note that although the tutorial is relevant to algorithmic trading in financial markets, it does not cover techniques for predicting price movements in financial markets.</p>

<h4><a name="sa3">SA3:</a> Traffic Management and AI</h4>
<p><b>Biplav Srivastava and Anand Ranganathan</b></p>

<p>The aim of the tutorial is to make early and experienced researchers aware of the traffic management area, provide an insightful overview of the current efforts in Research and in practice (real world pilots) that include AI techniques, and whet interest for newer efforts on important open issues.</p>

<p>The intended audience is a beginner to medium experienced researcher who is curious about AI in general and problems related to transportation and traffic management in particular. The tutorial will expect the audience to have a basic computer science background consisting of data structures, algorithms, databases and search.
Traffic management is a pressing problem for cities around the world. Moreover, it is a highly visible perspective of a city's life affecting all aspects of its citizens' economic and personal activities. Consequently, there is significant academic and commercial interest in addressing this problem. Although a long preserve of urban planners and civil engineers, traffic management had traditionally attracted limited attention in AI with major efforts in multiagent system, simulation and optimization. As the transportation industry adopts the intelligent transportation system vision, computer scientists in general, and AI researchers in particular, are looking at traffic management issues with renewed vigor employing more AI techniques. Furthermore, although there are existing techniques that are applicable to fairly structured traffic in developed countries (like USA, Europe, and Japan); there is paucity of methods that apply to chaotic traffic in developing countries (like India, Vietnam).</p>

<p>The topics we will cover include (1) <i>the traffic management problem,</i> which is often assumed but not well formalized. The proposers have done some latest work on this and presented at major traffic forum.</p>

<p>We will then cover (2) <i>sensing traffic data from the street.</i> This topic will include  important technologies for collecting raw data and converting them to traffic data (speed, volume) including (a) inductive-loop detectors as data source; (b) GPS-based vehicles as data source (c) Noisy methods for chaotic traffic (including call data record with telcos as data source and people-as-sensors); and (d) privacy issues in data collection.</p>

<p> We then cover (3) <i>traffic state estimation</i> (approaches, traffic flow models, fundamental diagrams); (4) <i>spatiotemporal analysis for traffic and user mobility patterns;</i> (5) <i>simulators for traffic analysis;</i> (6) <i>end-user analytics</i> (for city traffic prediction; for city congestion estimation; for citizens route recommendation; for citizens multimode travel recommendation using public transportation); (7) <i>traffic standards;</i> and (8) <i>practical considerations for pilot.</i></p>

<p>The AI topics we will cover are (1) learning; (2) filtering and state estimation; (3) graph and path analytics; (4) planning; (5) scheduling; (6) ontology; and (7) data mining.</p>

<h4><a name="sp1">SP1:</a> Collective Intelligence</h4>
<p><b>Haym Hirsh</b></p>

<p>"Collective intelligence" refers to ways that information and communications technologies are bringing people and computing together to achieve outcomes that were previously beyond our individual capabilities or expectations. Collective intelligence makes contact with AI in three ways. First, AI scholars and practitioners are using collective intelligence as an element in their work, such as to create corpora in computational linguistics or computer vision or to evaluate results in user interfaces or information retrieval. Second, AI knowledge, such as in machine learning and computational linguistics, has become a key enabler of many examples of collective intelligence, such as mining consumer behaviors and product review sentiments to facilitate product recommendation. Third, collective intelligence offers a provocative phenomenon to consider by those seeking computationally tractable understandings of intelligence. This tutorial will survey the state of the art in collective intelligence from an AI perspective. First, it will discuss examples of collective intelligence in which people explicitly act and participate in ways to achieve desired outcomes, such as editing Wikipedia articles, submitting or rating reviews at Amazon.com, or identifying astronomical objects in GalaxyZoo. Second, it will present examples in which collectively intelligent outcomes arise through the computationally distilled wisdom of the behaviors and products of individuals rather than through their explicit participation, as exhibited by Google's page ranking algorithm and Amazon's recommendation system. The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of prospects for the future, including ways that multiple forms of collective intelligence are being successfully integrated into larger systems, as well as examples where collective intelligence is being used in numerous undesirable ways.</p>

<h4><a name="sp2">SP2:</a> Probabilistic Matrix/tensor Block Models for Two-way/Multi-way Network Modeling</h4>
<p><b>Zenglin Xu and Alan Qi</b></p>

<p>Network analysis has been becoming an important research area in a number of disciplines, such as bioinformatics, system biology, economics, sensor networks, and social sciences. In this tutorial, we present an overview on principled Bayesian network modeling techniques with a focus on stochastic block models. We will cover basic theories of matrix- and tensor- variate distributions and processes and describe how to apply these theories to model network interactions, such as user-movie-time relations. Unlike classical bilinear or multilinear matrix/tensor factorization methods, Bayesian approaches can handle missing data, represent prediction uncertainty and yields interpretable results.</p>

<h4><a name="sp3">SP3:</a> Probabilistic Planning with Markov Decision Processes</h4>
<p><b>Andrey Kolobov and Mausam</b></p>

<p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a powerful tool for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, a core subfield of Artificial Intelligence. Their applications include planning advertising campaigns, putting together scientific agenda of a Mars Rover, playing games, and many others.</p>

<p>This tutorial takes an algorithmic approach to covering MDPs. It starts by describing the basic MDP types: finite, total discounted-reward, and stochastic shortest path MDPs. It then proceeds to techniques for solving them, from the oldest optimal ones (Value Iteration, Policy Iteration), to heuristic search algorithms (LAO*, LRTDP, etc.), to state-of-the-art approximation approaches such as RFF -- the special emphasis area of this tutorial. The lecture will conclude by discussing extensions to the established MDP classes and promising research directions.</p>

<p>The tutorial attendees are not expected to have any prior familiarity with MDPs, and will walk away with the knowledge of this field sufficient for conducting research in it.</p>

<h4><a name="ma1">MA1:</a> A Game Theoretic Approach to Social Networks</h4>
<p><b>Ramasuri Narayanam and Amit A. Nanavati</b></p>

<p>This tutorial provides the conceptual underpinnings of the use of game theoretic models in social network analysis and brings out how these models supplement and complement existing approaches for social network analysis. In the first part of the tutorial, we provide rigorous foundations of relevant concepts in game theory, mechanism design and social network analysis. In the second part of the tutorial, we bring out how game theoretic approach helps analyze social networks better and also how to apply the game theoretic concepts to problem solving in a rigorous way. In particular, we present a comprehensive study of a few contemporary and pertinent problems in social networks such as social network formation, social network monetization, design of incentive mechanisms, and economics of networks.</p>

<p>The tutorial deals with both theory and practice of the game theoretic models with applications to social network analysis. In particular, we first present in-depth understanding of the tools and techniques in game theory and mechanism design, and then present the practical utility of these theoretical concepts by addressing important problems associated with strategic and economic aspects of social networks. In this process, we also present case studies of a few relevant and deployed multiagent systems. It is important to note the primary content of this tutorial comes from game theory, mechanism design, and networked multiagent systems in general.</p>

<h4><a name="ma2">MA2:</a> Heuristic Search: The Basics and Beyond</h4>
<p><b>
Wheeler Ruml and Jordan Thayer</b></p>

<p>Heuristic search is seeing widespread use in applications from video games and robot motion planning to parsing and sequence alignment. This tutorial provides an introductory survey covering both classical and contemporary algorithms in shortest-path graph search. Both theoretical and implementation issues will be discussed. We will start with the setting of searching for optimal solutions (for example, A*) and move on to searching for any solution, searching for solutions under cost bounds, and searching under time bounds. In addition to classical lower bounds on solution cost, we will discuss how to incorporate estimates of solution cost and length in order to speed up search. Our emphasis will be on distinguishing different problem settings, identifying algorithms that apply to each, and developing intuitions for when each algorithm will perform well or poorly.</p>

<p><b>Mihail Pivtoraiko, Maxim Likhachev, and Sven Koenig</b></p>

<p>Many real-world planning problems push the limits of traditional AI solutions. Competent reasoning systems, such as robots, must make split-second decisions, while facing considerable challenges in their environment. Systematic search is a traditional planning tool due to a number of beneficial features, yet it does not scale well to many realistic planning problems. This four-hour tutorial attempts to demonstrate that a large class of real-world hard problems &mdash; involving high dimensionality and differential constraints &mdash; can be solved efficiently using systematic graph search enabled with algorithmic and representation improvements.</p>

<p>It is our goal to make the tutorial a stand-alone discussion and not to place strict prerequisites on the background of the audience. In particular, we only assume that the audience will be familiar with the rudimentary concepts in planning and search. We will strive to make the tutorial as interactive as possible, and we will review any concepts as needed. The discussion will be illustrated with plentiful examples, including recent fielded robotics systems such as nonholonomic mining trucks, autonomous cars (including Boss, the winner of the DARPA Urban Challenge), high-DOF mobile manipulators, autonomous aerial vehicles and quadruped robots, among others.</p>

<h4><a name="mp1">MP1:</a> Entity Resolution: Theory, Practice and Open Challenges</h4>
<p><b>Lise Getoor and Ashwin Machanavajjhala</b></p>

<p>Entity resolution (ER), the problem of extracting, matching and resolving entity mentions in structured and unstructured data, is a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence, statistics, information retrieval, and database management. It has been approached using a variety of techniques, including constraint-based methods, statistical methods, and methods which perform probabilistic inference. Accurate and fast entity resolution has huge practical implications in a wide variety of commercial, scientific and security domains.</p>

<p>This tutorial gives an overview of practical aspects and theoretical approaches to the problem of entity resolution. It summarizes ER research from AI, machine learning, database and information retrieval communities. In addition to giving attendees a thorough understanding of existing ER models, algorithms and evaluation methods, the tutorial will cover important research topics such as scalable ER, active and lightly supervised ER, and query-driven ER. The tutorial will also include a hands-on segment, where attendees will have the opportunity to try existing algorithms on sample datasets. The tutorial will close with a discussion of larger, related topics such as identity management and privacy.</p>

<h4><a name="mp2">MP2:</a> Text Mining from User Generated Content</h4>
<p><b>Ronen Feldman and Lyle Ungar</b></p>

<p>The proliferation of documents available on the Web and on corporate intranets is driving a new wave of text mining research and application. Earlier research addressed extraction of information from relatively small collections of well-structured documents such as newswire or scientific publications. Text mining from the other corpora such as the web requires new techniques drawn from data mining, machine learning, NLP and IR. Text mining requires preprocessing document collections (text categorization, information extraction, term extraction), storage of the intermediate representations, analysis of these intermediate representations (distribution analysis, clustering, trend analysis, association rules, etc.), and visualization of the results. In this tutorial we will present the algorithms and methods used to build text mining systems. The tutorial will cover the state of the art in this rapidly growing area of research, including recent advances in unsupervised methods for extracting facts from text and methods used for web-scale mining. We will also present several real world applications of text mining. Special emphasis will be given to lessons learned from years of experience in developing real world text mining systems, including recent advances in sentiment analysis and how to handle user generated text such as blogs and user reviews.</p>

<h4><a name="mp3">MP3:</a> Theory and Practice of Answer Set Programming</h4>
<p><b>
Esra Erdem, Joohyung Lee, and Yuliya Lierler</b></p>

<p>Answer set programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm oriented towards knowledge-intensive tasks and combinatorial search problems. Its main idea is to reduce the given search problem to computing stable models of a logic program, and to use an ASP solver to perform search. ASP is particularly suited for modeling incomplete, inconsistent and dynamic domains. It has become a major knowledge representation formalism and has been applied to several areas in AI including planning, diagnosis, information integration, and bioinformatics. Wide applications of ASP motivated various extensions to the language and implementations, including integrations of ASP with constraint satisfaction and description logics. Recently, the stable model semantics, a mathematical basis of ASP, is shown to be closely related to classical logic.</p>

<p>The tutorial will provide an interactive, educational session to introduce the current state of the art in declarative problem solving via ASP. The audience will walk away with an understanding of the mathematical foundation of ASP, algorithms and systems for computing answer sets, recent applications of ASP including biomedical query answering systems and cognitive robotics, and the applicability of ASP to problems of their own interests.</p>

<p><i>Prerequisite knowledge:</i> Basic knowledge of first-order logic will be assumed.</p>
