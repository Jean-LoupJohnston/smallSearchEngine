The AAAI-07 Intelligent Systems Demonstrations program showcases state-of-the-art AI implementations and provides AI researchers with an opportunity to show applications of their research in action. The program is intended to highlight innovative contributions to the science of AI with an emphasis on the benefits to be gained from developing and using implemented systems in AI research.</p><p>This year's demonstrations cover a broad range of domains: game playing, semantic web, distributed optimization, intelligent tutors, and more. System builders will be on hand to present their work. All that is needed to make this evening a big success is your active exploration of these interactive systems!</p><h3 class="text2">Table #5</h3><p><b>An Interactive Constraint-Based Approach to Sudoku</b><br />Christopher G. Reeson (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), Kai-Chen Huang (USC/Information Sciences Institute), Berthe Y. Choueiry (University of Nebraska-Lincoln and USC/Information Sciences Institute)</p><p>We present a Java applet that allows a user to interactively solve a Sudoku puzzle using Constraint Processing (CP) techniques. Our system showcases the power of CP techniques in solving problems through a widely familiar and easily approachable puzzle. It allows the users to apply several consistency algorithms or work independently of our algorithms. The system is available online: sudoku.unl.edu/Solver and sudoku.unl.edu/Constructor.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #6</h3><p><b>AURA: Enabling Domain Experts to Construct Declarative Knowledge Bases from Science Textbooks</b><br />Ken Barker (University of Texas at Austin), Vinay Chaudhri (SRI international), Shaw-Yi Chaw (University of Texas at Austin), Peter E. Clark (The Boeing Company), Daniel Hansch (Ontoprise), Bonnie John (Carnegie Mellon University), Sunil Mishra (SRI international), John Pacheco (SRI International), Bruce Porter (University of Texas at Austin), Aaron Spaulding (SRI international), Moritz Weiten (Ontoprise)</p><p>We will demonstrate the AURA system that can enable students in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology to author knowledge in a college level science textbook in a way that the resulting knowledge base can be used to answer questions from an Advanced Placement examination in the respective discipline. The system supports a knowledge formulation interface based on concept maps, equations, tables and a query formulation interface based on controlled English. We will also demonstrate a semantic Wiki application for collaborative knowledge formulation and show how users can map large amounts of the Wiki&rsquo;s knowledge into AURA.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #1</h3><p><b>A Demonstration of ScriptEase Interruptible and Resumable Behaviors for CRPGs</b><br />Maria Cutumisu, Duane Szafron, Jonathan Schaeffer, Kevin Waugh, Curtis Onuczko, Jeff Siegel, Allan Schumacher (University of Alberta)</p><p>We developed a behavior model based on generative design patterns for intelligent non-player characters (NPCs) using ScriptEase that solves the difficult problem of interacting NPCs and of interruptible and resumable behaviors. We demonstrate how this model generates complex NPC behaviors from behavior patterns in a commercial game without writing code.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #2</h3><p><b>A Deployed Semantically-Enabled Interdisciplinary Virtual Observatory</b><br />Deborah McGuinness (Stanford University and McGuinness Associates), Peter Fox (National Center for Atmospheric Research), Luca Cinquini (National Center for Atmospheric Research), Patrick West (National Center for Atmospheric Research), Jose Garcia (National Center for Atmospheric Research), James L. Benedict (McGuinness Associates), Don Middleton (National Center for Atmospheric Research)</p><p>We have used semantic technologies to design, implement, and deploy an interdisciplinary virtual observatory. The Virtual Solar-Terrestrial Observatory is a production data framework providing access to observational datasets. It is in use by a community of scientists, students, and data providers interested in the middle and upper Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and the Sun. The data sets span upper atmospheric terrestrial physics to solar physics. The observatory allows virtual access to a highly distributed and heterogeneous set of data that appears as if all resources are organized, stored and accessible from a local machine. The system has been operational since the summer of 2006 and has shown registered data access by over 75% of the active community (last count over 600 of the estimated 800 person active research community). This demonstration will highlight how semantic technologies are being used to support data integration and more efficient data access in a multi-disciplinary setting. A full paper on this work is being published in the IAAI 07 deployed paper track.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #7</h3><p><b>Evac-Op: Disaster Evacuation Support</b><br />Christopher J. Carpenter, Christopher J. Dugan, Joseph B. Kopena, Robert N. Lass, Gaurav Naik, Duc N. Nguyen, Evan Sultanik, Pragnesh Jay Modi, William C. Regli (Drexel University)</p><p>Evac-Op is a prototype system for assisting emergency personnel in monitoring and conducting evacuation and sheltering operations. It is a novel application of distributed constraint optimization combined with mobile wireless networking to sharing situation information and making global decisions on issues such as shelter assignments. In addition to exploring this application and new applications of distributed constraint optimization, Evac-Op is intended as a vehicle for investigating distributed decision making under poor communications, uncertainty, and change.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #3</h3><p><b>A Framework for Experimental Research of Autonomous Trading Agents</b><br />Eric Sodomka, John Collins, Maria Gini (University of Minnesota)</p><p>The Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management is a market simulation in which autonomous agents act as manufacturers in a two- tier supply chain marketplace. The objective of this demonstration is to showcase various methods our research team and others have developed in this domain to run simulations and analyze agent performance in an efficient manner.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #4</h3><p><b>Freebase: A Shared Database of Structured General Human Knowledge</b><br />Kurt Bollacker and Timothy Kientzle (Metaweb Technologies, Inc.)</p><p>Freebase is a practical, scalable, graph-shaped database of structured, general human knowledge, inspired by Semantic Web research and collaborative data communities such as the Wikipedia. Freebase allows public reads and writes through an HTTP-based graph-query API and a sophisticated AJAX for web access. (See www.freebase.com)</p><h3 class="text2">Table #8</h3><p><b>Generating and Solving Logic Puzzles through Constraint Satisfaction</b><br />Barry O'Sullivan and John Horan (University College Cork, Ireland)</p><p>Solving logic puzzles has become a very popular pasttime, particularly since the Sudoku puzzle started appearing in newspapers all over the world. We have developed a puzzle generator for a modification of Sudoku, called Jidoku, in which clues are binary disequalities between cells on a 9x9 grid. Our generator guarantees that puzzles have unique solutions, have graded difficulty, and can be solved using inference alone.</p><p>This demonstration provides a fun application of many standard constraint satisfaction techniques, such as problem formulation, global constraints, search and inference. It is ideal as both an education and outreach tool. Our demonstration will allow people to generate and interactively solve puzzles of user-selected difficulty, with the aid of hints if required, through a specifically built Java applet.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #10</h3><p><b>The More the Merrier: Multi-Party Negotiation with Virtual Humans</b><br />Patrick Kenny, Arno Hartholt, Jonathan Gratch, David Traum, Stacy Marsella, Bill Swartout (USC/Institute for Creative Technologies)</p><p>The Institute for Creative Technologies at USC virtual human demo will focus on fully embodied conversational characters that contain task and emotion models. The user will use natural speech to negotiate with the agents to move a clinic. The agents will engage in multi-party dialogue using verbal and non-verbal behavior.</p><h3 class="text2">Table #9</h3><p><b>The PhotoSlap Game: Play to Annotate</b><br />Tsung-Hsiang Chang, Chien-Ju Ho, and Jane Yung-jen Hsu (National Taiwan University)</p><p>PhotoSlap, an intelligent system for semantic annotation of photos, contains a semi-automatic face detector, a bulk annotation tool, and a multi-player online game. By exploring the design principles of gameplay and applying game theoretic analysis, PhotoSlap is designed as a fun and productive game, which adapts itself to different players to produce the desired output.</p><!--<p>The AAAI Intelligent Systems Demonstrations program showcases state-of-the-art AI implementations and provides AI researchers with an opportunity to show their research in action. Implemented intelligent systems allow us not only to experimentally validate AI research, but also to make AI research accessible to each other, to the broader scientific community, and to the public at large. </p><p>Researchers from all areas of AI are encouraged to <a href="../aaai-isd-application.php">submit proposals</a> to demonstrate their systems. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their innovation, relevance, scientific contribution, presentation, and usability, as well as potential logistical constraints. This program is primarily to encourage the early exhibition of research prototypes, but interesting mature systems and commercial products are also eligible (commercial sales and marketing activities are not appropriate in the Intelligent Systems Demonstration program, and should be arranged as part of the AAAI-07 Exhibits program). Demonstrations that can be used by the audience and/or that interact with the audience are particularly encouraged.</p><p>It is likely that this program will be part of a conference-wide poster and demonstration session one evening during the conference. Demonstration systems should be available during the entire session. Each accepted demonstration system must be attended by at least one knowledgeable representative (preferably an architect of the system) who will be available to answer in-depth technical questions at scheduled times.</p><p>Demonstration proposals must be made electronically using the <a href="../aaai-isd-application.php">form at the AAAI web site.</a> Please check the AAAI-07 conference page for further details after October 1, 2006. In addition to contact information, proposals must include the following items. All should be submitted via the online form, unless a video is being submitted. Please send videos directly to the cochairs.</p><p>A two-page description in AAAI paper format of the technical content of the demo,including credits and references. These descriptions will appear in the conference proceedings.</p><p><i>A 150-word summary of the demonstration in plain text.</i> Please include title, demonstrator names, and affiliation(s).  This summary will be used to compile a program for the demonstrations. Please keep the descriptions under the 150-word limit.</p><p><i>A demo storyboard</i> of not more than six pages total or an informal video of the demo (in MPEG or Quicktime format) that describes how the demonstration will proceed (as opposed to the technical merits of the research being demonstrated). This is the committee&rsquo;s primary method of evaluating your proposal. Please emphasize the elements that make your demonstration exciting and interesting.</p><p><i>A detailed description of hardware and software requirements.</i> Demonstrators are encouraged to be flexible in their requirements (possibly with different demos for different logistical situations). Please state what you can bring yourself and what you absolutely must have provided. Generally speaking, we can provide computer monitors and peripherals such as TVs and VCRs, as well as a network connection. Each demonstration will be assigned a table-top in the exhibition area.</p><p>Demo proposals must be received in their entirety, including any supporting materials, by Tuesday, April 3, 2007. Authors will be notified of acceptance by April 16, 2007.</p><p>We especially hope that authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference technical program will be able to demonstrate their research in the AAAI Intelligent Systems Demonstration Program. To present a system demonstration, however, the authors must still <a href="../aaai-isd-application.php">submit</a> a proposal conforming to the above requirements by the Demonstration program deadline. Submitters who wish to demonstrate intelligent mechanical systems that interact with the real world (aka &ldquo;robots&rdquo;) should direct their efforts toward the Robot Exhibition. If you have any questions or comments about the AAAI Intelligent Systems Demonstration program, we encourage you to address them to the program chair, Rob Miller (&#114;&#99;&#109;&#64;&#109;&#105;&#116;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;).</p>--><!-- <p>The AAAI Intelligent Systems Demonstrations program showcases state-of-the-art AI implementations and provides AI researchers with an opportunity to show their research in action.
