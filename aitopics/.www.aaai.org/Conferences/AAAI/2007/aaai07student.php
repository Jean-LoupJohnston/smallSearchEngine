<p>The AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence &mdash; AAAI's summer
national conference &mdash; promotes theoretical and applied AI research as
well as intellectual interchange among researchers and practitioners.
The technical program features substantial, original research and
practices. Conference panel discussions and invited presentations
identify significant social, philosophical, and economic issues
influencing AI's development throughout the world.</p>
<p>AAAI encourages students to become members and to participate in the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Information about programs, scholarship
information, and other information of particular interest to students
can be found on this page.</p>

<h3 class="text2">AAAI Fellow / Student Lunches</h3>

<p>First held in 2006, this program provides an opportunity for a small number of students to chat with a AAAI Fellow over an informal lunch during the conference. Preregistration prior to the conference was required. Preregistered students should meet their designated Fellow in onsite registration in the Regency Ballroom foyer on their assigned day.</p>

<h3 class="text2">AAAI-07 Student Website</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://pegasus2.isi.edu/aaai07-studentinfo/blog/">AAAI-07 Blog</a> is a student run blog that describes and documents AAAI-07 and IAAI-07 from a student's perspective. A small group of student bloggers attending the conferences will post daily items describing their observations, experiences, reactions, thoughts and questions. Pictures from the conference will be uploaded to the linked photo blog. Other students attending AAAI are welcome to participate by adding their own observations via comments attached to posts and photographs. In addition, AAAI-07 Student Participation Cochairs Martin Michalowski and Matt Michelson have consolidated lots of information for student attendees in Vancouver, including news about the new student reception. For more information, please visit the <a href="http://pegasus2.isi.edu/aaai07-studentinfo/index.shtml">Student Information Website.</a></p>

In the event that scholarship applications exceed available funds, preference will be given to students who have an accepted technical paper, and then to students who are actively participating in the conference in some way. However, all eligible students are encouraged to apply.</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2007/aaai07scholarship-app.pdf">Scholarship and Volunteer Application</a></li></ul>

<p>After the conference, an expense report will be required to account for the funds awarded. For further information about the Scholarship Program, or to obtain an application, please contact AAAI at &#115;&#99;&#104;&#111;&#108;&#97;&#114;&#115;&#104;&#105;&#112;&#115;&#48;&#55;&#64;&#97;&#97;&#97;&#105;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;.</p>



<p><i>The Student Volunteer Program</i> is an essential part of the conference and student participation is a valuable contribution. Volunteers will support AAAI organizers in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2007, a limited number of complimentary technical program registrations will be available for students who volunteer during the conference. Preference will be given to student scholars for the volunteer positions. Local students or students not requiring travel assistance can apply for the Volunteer Program if openings are available. AAAI membership is required for eligibility. For further information regarding the Student Volunteer Program, please contact AAAI at &#118;&#111;&#108;&#117;&#110;&#116;&#101;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#48;&#55;&#64;&#97;&#97;&#97;&#105;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;. The deadline for volunteer applications is <b>April 30, 2007.</b></p>

<h3 class="text2">Student Abstracts and Poster Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the student abstracts and poster program is to provide a forum at the AAAI national conference in which students can present and discuss their work during its early stages, meet some of their peers who have related interests, and introduce themselves to more senior members of the field. The program is open to all pre-Ph.D. students. Nonstudent advisors or collaborators should be acknowledged appropriately, as coauthors or otherwise. However, students are requested to honor the spirit of the program by submitting only work for which they are primary investigators. </p>

<h3 class="text2">Doctoral Consortium Program</h3>
<p>The Doctoral Consortium (DC) provides an opportunity for a group of Ph.D. students to discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives in an interdisciplinary workshop together with a panel of established researchers. The consortium has the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide a setting for mutual feedback on participants' current research, and guidance on future research directions 
</li><li>To develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research 
</li><li>To support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on academic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths 
</li><li>To contribute to the conference goals through interaction with other researchers and participation in conference events. 
</li></ul>
