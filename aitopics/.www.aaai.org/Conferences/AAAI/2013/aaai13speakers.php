<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Mooney">Keynote Address</a></i><br />Grounded Language Learning</h3>
<p><b>Raymond J. Mooney (University of Texas at Austin)</b></p>

<p>
Most approaches to semantics in computational linguistics represent meaning in terms of words or abstract symbols. Grounded-language research bases the meaning of natural language on perception and/or action in the (real or virtual) world. Machine learning has become the most effective approach to constructing natural-language systems; however, current methods require a great deal of laboriously annotated training data. Ideally, a computer would be able to acquire language like a child, by being exposed to language in the context of a relevant but ambiguous environment, thereby grounding its learning in perception and action. We will review recent research in grounded language learning and discuss future directions.

Fighting the Tuberculosis Pandemic Using Machine Learning</h3>
<p><b>Kristin P. Bennett and the TB-Insight Team (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)</b></p>

<p>
<img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2013/Photos/bennett.jpg" alt="Kristin P. Bennett" width="59" height="75" class="img1" />Tuberculosis (TB) infects one third of the world's population and is the second leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide. The emergence of drug resistant TB remains a constant threat. We examine how machine learning methods can help control tuberculosis. DNA fingerprints of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex bacteria (Mtb) are routinely gathered from TB patient isolates for every tuberculosis patient in the United States to support TB tracking and control efforts. We develop learning models to predict the genetic lineages of Mtb based on DNA fingerprints. Mining of tuberculosis patient surveillance data with respect to these genetic lineages helps discover outbreaks, improve TB control, and reveal Mtb phenotype differences. We discuss learning- and visualization-based tools to support public health efforts towards TB control in development for the New York City Health Department.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Mataric">AAAI-13 Invited Talk</a></i><br />
Socially Assistive Robotics: Human-Robot Interaction Methods for Creating Robots that Care</h3>
<p><b>Maja J. Mataric' (University of Southern California)</b></p>

<p>Socially assistive robotics (SAR) is a new field of intelligent robotics that focuses on developing machines capable of assisting users through social rather than physical interaction. The robot's physical embodiment is at the heart of SAR's effectiveness, as it leverages the inherently human tendency to engage with lifelike (but not necessarily humanlike or otherwise biomimetic) social behavior. People readily ascribe intention, personality, and emotion to robots; SAR leverages this engagement stemming from non-contact social interaction involving speech, gesture, movement demonstration and imitation, and encouragement, to develop robots capable of monitoring, motivating, and sustaining user activities and improving human learning, training, performance and health outcomes. Human-robot interaction (HRI) for SAR is a growing multifaceted research area at the intersection of engineering, health sciences, neuroscience, social, and cognitive sciences. This talk will describe our research into embodiment, modeling and steering social dynamics, and long-term user adaptation for SAR. The research will be grounded in projects involving analysis of multi-modal activity data, modeling personality and engagement, formalizing social use of space and non-verbal communication, and personalizing the interaction with the user over a period of months, among others. The presented methods and algorithms will be validated on implemented SAR systems evaluated by human subject cohorts from a variety of user populations, including stroke patients, children with autism spectrum disorder, and elderly with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Sandholm">AAAI-13 Invited Talk</a></i><br />
Poker AI: Algorithms for Creating Game-Theoretic Strategies for Large Incomplete-Information Games</h3>
<p><b>Tuomas Sandholm (Carnegie Mellon University)</b></p>

<p>
Incomplete-information games &mdash; such as most auctions, negotiations, and future (cyber)security settings &mdash; cannot be solved using minimax search even in principle. Completely different algorithms were needed. A dramatic scalability leap has occurred in our ability to solve such games over the last seven years, fueled largely by the Annual Computer Poker Competition. I will discuss the key domain-independent techniques that enabled this leap, including automated abstraction techniques and approaches for mitigating the issues that they raise, new equilibrium-finding algorithms, safe opponent exploitation methods, techniques that use qualitative knowledge as an extra input, and endgame solving techniques. I will finish by benchmarking poker programs against the best human poker professionals and by discussing what humans can learn from the programs.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Birnbaum">Joint AAAI/IAAI Invited Talk</a></i><br />Telling Stories at Internet Scale</h3>
<p><b>Larry Birnbaum (Northwestern University)</b></p>
<p>Taking full advantage of the massive scale of "big data" will require technologies for analyzing and communicating these data to people, in terms they can understand and act on, at an equally massive scale. The automatic generation of narratives from data offers the promise of meeting this critical need. Our technology, which leverages human editorial judgment at scale, is today generating millions of stories from data, including highly personalized stories, in domains varying from business operations, to sports, education, medicine, and finance.  The resulting narratives are often indistinguishable from those written by human analysts and writers.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Hunter">IAAI-13 Invited Talk</a></i><br />Building a Mind for Life</h3>
<p><b>Lawrence Hunter (University of Colorado)</b></p>
<p>Sometimes two hard problems are easier than one. Making sense of the explosion to data about life and human health that arises from exponentially improving DNA sequencing technology is one of the primary scientific challenges of our time. Artificial intelligence is based in the equally profound question of what constitutes a mind and how one could be constructed artificially. These two challenges mutually inform and constrain each other. Computational biology needs tools that relate enormous experimental results to vast amounts of relevant prior knowledge in ways that illuminate the mechanisms underlying the phenomena under study. This is a fundamentally semantic process that requires programs represent complex, incomplete and partially incorrect knowledge, reason about it and its relation to experimental results, and engage in effective, ongoing scientific communication about hypotheses. This is an "AI-complete" problem. However, the domain is special in several ways: (1) All the relevant knowledge is explicit, and can be found in the roughly 10,000 textbooks and 20 million journal articles that make up the biomedical literature. (2) The biomedical research community has a long-standing and effective project in ontology development, provide an increasingly comprehensive conceptual foundation of entities, processes, functions, locations, relations and more that are explicitly defined, rigorously organized and maintained by domain experts. These biomedical ontologies underpin several large-scale annotation projects, the results of which are available in standardized semantic formats like RDF and OWL. (3) There is a large community of biomedical research scientists desperate for effective means of explaining and contextualizing their data. Although they are demanding and less interested in the technological means than the scientific ends, a thoughtful human community eager to interact in an extended intellectual partnership with programs is a rare and valuable resource for AI research. This combination of factors suggests that the first wildly acknowledged genuine AI may think about biology. I will talk about progress to date and prospects in building a mind for life.</p>

Applying AI to Vehicle Failure Monitoring for Autonomous Vehicle Durability Testing</h3>
<p><b>Nestor Rychtyckyj and Howie (Hao) Yang (Ford Motor Company)</b></p>

<p>Recently Ford Motor Company has deployed autonomous testing vehicles for automated driving at the Michigan Proving Grounds. These nonproduction (prototype) vehicles are used for durability testing over a variety of extreme terrain and conditions that are very difficult on human drivers. A vehicle with autonomous driving capability can be driven over the same difficult terrain numerous times at a consistent rate of speed. However, the ability of the human driver to detect issues with the car during these tests is still a major requirement. In this talk we will discuss the development and deployment of an AI-based system that is used to monitor the vehicle for any mechanical failures.  This system processes signals from a variety of different in-vehicle sensors that provide data about the vehicle performance during each test run. The AI system analyzes the data and sends messages to the vehicle tracking center if any issues occur with the vehicle and the operator at the tracking center can stop the vehicle to prevent any potential damage.   Various factors such a noise, vibration, speed, torque are all used by the system and the necessary knowledge to reason with data on a real-time basis that decides what information needs to be sent to the control center is all incorporated into the system. This application shows how AI technology can be integrated into a real-world system that provides tangible benefits for both Ford and its customers.</p>

Learning in the Lab at Midnight: Experiences from Teaching AI at Berkeley and Online</h3>
<p><b>Dan Klein (University of California, Berkeley)</b></p>

<p>Where does learning really happen? Only a little happens in lecture; most students learn much more working with friends in the lab at midnight. The modern student experience increasingly revolves around coursework, peer assistance, and asynchronous interactions &mdash; not lectures, textbooks, and office hours. With these trends only increasing as enrollments rise and online channels emerge, how should we design our AI courses?</p>

<p>I'll talk about the best answers we've found so far for the Berkeley AI course. One key component of our approach is a set of thematically coherent, autograded projects that engage students and integrate with lectures in an ongoing way. More generally, I'll focus on several questions that have shaped our course, including: What should the role of a modern lecture be? What's the balance between cooperative learning and competition? When is an autograder more useful than a human TA?  Why are students even taking AI in the first place? Finally, I'll talk about how technology that we originally developed for pedagogical purposes, such as rich autograding, has helped the course scale from tens to hundreds of students on campus and now to tens of thousands online.</p>

<p>Our experiences have resulted in a large number of re-usable materials, which we're always excited to share. I'll conclude with a discussion of how other instructors can take advantage of our lectures, interactive assignments, and autograded projects, which have already been used by over a hundred AI courses.</p>

Broader and Earlier Access to Machine Learning</h3>
<p><b>Paula Matuszek (Villanova University)</b></p>

<p>In a world of big data, everyone needs machine learning. How do we teach it to everyone? At Villanova we have embarked on an NSF-funded project to develop a set of machine-learning modules for students from a wide variety of domains. Our goal is to have students who can make intelligent and effective use of appropriate machine learning algorithms and techniques as tools. In this talk I will describe our grant and share the state of the modules we have so far, in order to stimulate discussion about how we can teach machine learning more broadly.</p>
