<h4><a name="sa1">SA1:</a> Combining Logic and Probability: Languages, Algorithms, and Applications</h4>
<p><b>Pedro Domingos and Kristian Kersting</b></p>

<p>AI problems are characterized by high degrees of complexity and uncertainty. Complexity is well handled by first-order logic, and uncertainty by probability. Combining the two in one language would be highly desirable, and the last decade has seen rapid progress in this direction. Many probabilistic logical languages have been proposed, and efficient inference and learning algorithms for them are available, often in open source software. Probabilistic logical techniques have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems in natural language processing, vision, robotics, planning, social networks, the web, and other areas.</p>

<p>This tutorial begins with an overview of the key issues in this area and the solutions that have been proposed, from representation to learning and inference. As an example, we then focus on Markov logic, which attaches weights to first-order formulas and treats them as templates for features of log-linear models. We look in particular at the application of lifting techniques to probabilistic inference in relational domains (such as lifted loopy belief propagation, lifted linear programming, and probabilistic theorem proving), the combination of statistical learning with inductive logic programming (statistical relational learning), and the application of these techniques to machine reading.</p>

<p>This tutorial will be of immense use to motivated students and AI researchers in general who wish to pursue research in statistical relational AI. It aims at motivating and explaining a topic of emerging importance for AI. No special background is assumed.

<h4><a name="sa2">SA2:</a> Decision Diagrams for Discrete Optimization</h4>
<p><b>Willem-Jan Van Hoeve</b></p>

<p>This presents an overview of the recent successful applications of multivalued decision diagrams (MDDs) to discrete optimization problems, with applications to constraint programming, scheduling, and integer optimization.</p>

<p>In the first part of the tutorial, attendees will learn how constraint propagation algorithms can be extended to operate on MDDs. By propagating MDDs instead of variable domains, more structural information can be communicated between constraints, which can lead to substantial speedups.</p>

<p>The second part of the tutorial will focus on the use of MDDs in the context of constraint-based scheduling. In particular, we discuss how MDDs can be effectively applied to solve complex disjunctive scheduling problems, and are able to outperform state of the art industrial CP solvers by orders of magnitude in certain cases.</p>

<p>The third part of the tutorial discusses the application of limited-size MDDs to obtain upper and lower bounds for integer optimization problems. The resulting discrete bounds can be much stronger than continuous bounds based on linear programming, while being faster to compute.</p>

<h4><a name="sa3">SA3:</a> Game Theory for Security</h4>
<p><b>Albert Xin Jiang, Manish Jain, Rong Yang, and Bo An</b></p>

<p>Game theory is an increasingly important paradigm for modeling security games and decision-making in these domains, including homeland security resource allocation decisions, robot patrolling strategies, and computer network security. Several deployed real-world systems use game theory to randomize critical security decisions to prevent terrorists and criminals from exploiting a predictable security schedule. The ARMOR system has been deployed at the Los Angeles International Airport since 2007 and the IRIS system has been deployed by the Federal Air Marshals Service since 2009. PROTECT has been deployed in the port of Boston since April 2011, has been in use at the port of New York since February 2012, and is headed for nationwide deployment; GUARDS is under evaluation for national deployment by the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and TRUSTS is being tested by the Los Angeles Sheriffs Department (LASD) in the Los Angeles Metro system to schedule randomized patrols for fare inspection.</p>

<p>This tutorial will introduce a wide variety of game-theoretic modeling techniques and algorithms that have been developed in recent years for security problems. Introductory material on game theory and mathematical programming (optimization) will be included in the tutorial, so there is no prerequisite knowledge for participants. After introducing the basic security game framework, we will describe algorithms for scaling to very large games, methods for modeling uncertainty and attacker observation capabilities in security games, and applications of these techniques for randomized resource allocation and patrolling problems. We will then talk about progress in the recent research area of game theory and human behavior, which deals with developing algorithms that perform well against human opponents.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the tutorial we will highlight the many opportunities for future work in this area, including exciting new domains and fundamental theoretical and algorithmic challenges.</p>

<p>Our primary target audience is students and other novices who will benefit from an extensive introduction to one of the most important areas of applied multiagent systems research. This tutorial should also be of interest to researchers in the topic of human behavior, since we describe the application of concepts from behavioral game theory. We also anticipate that this tutorial will appeal to industry participants interested in applied work, and to game theory practitioners who may be interested in learning more about the specific techniques employed in this important class of games.</p>

<p>The primary tools the audience can learn are game theoretic models for security scenarios and exact/approximate algorithms to find solutions. The audience will also learn how concepts from behavioral game-theory have been applied and deployed in the context of security games. Although it is not the primary objective of the tutorial, attendees can learn also basic groundings on game theory and algorithmic game theory.

<p>The proliferation of user generated content on the web is driving a new wave work on the determination of user sentiment from web texts such as message boards, blogs, tweets, and Facebook status updates. Both researchers and practitioners are developing and applying new methods to determine how users feel about everything: products and politicians, friends and family, scientific articles and celebrities. This tutorial will cover the state of the art in this rapidly growing area, including recent advances that combine information extraction with sentiment analysis to improve accuracy in assessing sentiment about specific entities. We will present several real world applications of sentiment analysis. Special emphasis will be given to lessons learned from years of experience in developing real world sentiment analysis systems.

<h4><a name="sp1">SP1:</a> Deep Learning of Representation</h4>
<p><b>Yoshua Bengio</b></p>

<p>The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on how data are represented, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms. In particular, deep learning involves the discovery of multiple levels of representation, and is supported both by theoretical arguments and recent breakthroughs using deep learning in applications and industry, from computer vision and natural language processing to speech recognition, modeling music, and outperforming other methods in transfer settings (generalizing to new classes or contexts). We view the ultimate goal of representation learning algorithms as disentangling the unknown underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. This tutorial reviews the basics of feature learning and deep learning, which can often be viewed as relying on broad priors about AI tasks. The tutorial also covers recent work relating representation learning to probabilistic modeling (the discovery of latent variables explaining the observed data) and manifold learning (the discovery of the local geometric structures near which the data generating distribution concentrates). The audience will also be introduced to practical guidelines and how to set hyperparameters for representation learning, following a recently published book on the subject. A final objective is to raise questions and issues about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (that is, inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2013/Photos/bengio.jpg" alt="Yoshua Bengio" width="55" height="65" class="img1" /><b>Yoshua Bengio</b>'s lab was one of the three (University of Toronto, University of Montreal, New York University) that launched the area of deep learning in 2006. Since then Bengio has been one of the most prolific contributors to the area, and setup the deeplearning.net community web site (recently followed by a Google+ community). Bengio is a member of the Neural Information Processing Systems board. He was program chair for NIPS'2008 and general chair for NIPS'2009. He coorganized with Yann LeCun the Learning Workshop from 1999 to 2012, and together they also created the upcoming International Conference on Learning Representations. Bengio holds the Canada Research Chair on Statistical Learning Algorithms, and is a Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He also holds a National Science and Engineering Research Council Chair. He was an actor in the creation of the <i>Journal of Machine Learning Research,</i> of which he is action editor. Bengio also holds or held editorial responsibilities for F<i>oundations and Trends in Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning,</i> and the <i>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks.</i> He was area chair for numerous conferences, including NIPS and ICML.

<h4><a name="sp2">SP2:</a> Prediction, Belief, and Markets</h4>
<p><b>Jenn Wortman Vaughan and Jacob Abernethy</b></p>

<p>This tutorial will cover some of the basic mathematical ideas used in the design of prediction markets, financial markets designed to aggregate opinions across large populations of traders, and illustrate several fundamental connections between these ideas and techniques used in machine learning. We will begin with an overview of proper scoring rules, which can be used to measure the accuracy of a single entity's prediction, and are closely related to proper loss functions. We will then discuss market scoring rules, automated market makers based on proper scoring rules which can be used to aggregate the predictions of many forecasters, and describe how market scoring rules can be implemented as inventory-based markets in which securities are bought and sold. We will describe recent research exploring a duality-based interpretation of market scoring rules which can be exploited to design new markets that can be run efficiently over very large state spaces. Finally, we will explore the fundamental mathematical connections between market scoring rules and two areas of machine learning: online "no-regret" learning and variational inference with exponential families. This tutorial will be self-contained. No background on markets or specific areas of machine learning is required.</p>

<h4><a name="sp3">SP3:</a> Symbolic Methods for Probabilistic Inference, Optimization, and Decision-Making</h4>
<p><b>Scott Sanner</b></p>

<p>This tutorial explores recent advances in symbolic data structures for exact probabilistic inference and decision-making in mixed discrete and continuous models. The tutorial is in two parts. In the first part, I introduce an extension of the algebraic decision diagram (ADD) to continuous variables &mdash; termed the extended ADD (XADD) &mdash; to represent arbitrary piecewise functions over discrete and continuous variables and show how to efficiently compute elementary arithmetic operations, integrals, and maximization for these functions. In the second part, I cover a wide range of novel applications where the XADD may be applied: (a) exact inference in expressive discrete and continuous variable graphical models, (b) factored, parameterized linear and quadratic optimization, and (c) exact solutions to continuous state and action Markov decision processes &mdash; which includes closed-form exact solutions to previously unsolved problems in operations research. The tutorial is accompanied by free software that audience members may wish to download in order to gain hands-on experience with examples from the tutorial.</p>

<p>Inference, that is the ability to derive conclusions from facts, is a central building block of intelligent behavior, and has predominantly been approached through the development of formal representations for knowledge that enable efficient inference.</p>

<p>The goal of the proposed tutorial is to provide an introduction to textual inference, a recent paradigm from natural language processing that provides an alternative approach to inference by defining it as a relation between natural language texts, avoiding commitment to any specific knowledge representation, inference procedure or learning approaches. It thus establishes a level playing field to compare and combine various approaches to inference as well as establishing an application-independent paradigm for applied semantics.</p>

<p>The proposed tutorial would take four hours, and span the range from fundamental to applied aspects of textual inference. It will cover the basics (motivation and definition); an overview of major strategies and algorithms;  methods for acquiring and applying the linguistic background knowledge necessary for deciding inference at the language level; and an introduction to practical system building using a new open and modular software platform for textual inference.</p>

<h4><a name="ma1">MA1:</a> Answer Set Solving in Practice</h4>
<p><b>Martin Gebser and Torsten Schaub</b></p>

<p>Answer set programming (ASP) provides a declarative tool for modeling various problems typical to Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in particular and AI in general. The unique pairing of declarativeness and performance allows for concentrating on an actual problem, rather than a smart way of implementing it. The ASP approach is not only highly suitable for the practitioner solving an AI problem at hand but also for disseminating many basic AI techniques through teaching their (executable) formalization in ASP.
The tutorial aims at acquainting the participant with ASP's modeling and solving methodology, enabling her/him to independent problem solving using ASP systems. To this end, it starts with an introduction to the essential formal concepts of ASP, needed for understanding its semantics and solving technology. With it, we provide a characterization of ASP's inference schemes that are in turn mapped into algorithms relying on advanced Boolean Constraint technology. We illustrate this technology through the ASP solver clasp. Similarly, ASP's grounding inferences are discussed in conjunction with (deductive) database techniques. The remainder of the tutorial is dedicated to applying ASP, involving an introduction to ASP's modeling language, its solving methodology, and advanced techniques fostering scalability. All involved ASP systems are freely available from potassco.sourceforge.net.</p>

<p>What makes this tutorial different from others on ASP is its focus on putting ASP at work. This comprises a good understanding of ASP solving technology and systems as well as basic skills in ASP's modeling capacities.</p>

<h4><a name="ma2">MA2:</a> From Bandits to Monte-Carlo Tree Search: The Optimistic Principle Applied to Games, Optimization, and Planning</h4>
<p><b>Remi Munos</b></p>

<p>This tutorial provides an introduction to the principle of "optimism in the face of uncertainty" from the simple multiarmed bandit to large scale decision making or optimization problems. Our initial motivation originated from the empirical success of the so-called Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) approach popularized in computer-go and further extended to many other games as well as optimization and planning problems. We will report elements of theory that enable to characterize the complexity of the underlying problems and describe efficient algorithms with performance guarantees.</p>

<p>The tutorial starts with an introduction to the stochastic multiarmed bandit and the presentation of the UCB strategy as well as several variants. Then the MCTS method and the UCT algorithm will be presented and the limitations of current approaches will be illustrated. Then we will follow the optimistic principle for the problem of function optimization under finite numerical budget and describe algorithms with nonasymptotic performance guarantees. We will explain how their performance relates to some measure of the quantity of near-optimal solutions as well as our knowledge of the "Local smoothness" of the function around its maxima.</p>

<h4><a name="ma3">MA3:</a> Information Trustworthiness</h4>
<p><b>Jeffrey Pasternack, Dan Roth and V. G. Vinod Vydiswaran</b></p>

<p>Decision makers and citizens are heavily influenced these days by information they obtain from online resources &mdash; from news portals, online encyclopedias, blogs and forums, product websites and reviews, etc. However, the lack of control over what gets published online can often lead to dissemination of unreliable and misleading information. In such a scenario, how can one verify if a claim is true or determine which sources are trustworthy?</p>

<p>In this tutorial, the instructors will systematically consider various approaches that address this problem. After briefly motivating and introducing the problem, the instructors would present the approaches that compute the trustworthiness of sources in isolation. Then, they would present the class of iterative, fact-finding approaches that are capable of estimating the trustworthiness of the source in addition to the believability of the claims. The presenters would extend the discussion to free-text claims, and present approaches that make use of textual evidence in favor of or against the claims in computing trustworthiness of sources and claims. Finally, they will present challenges in presenting credible information to users to help them validate claims.</p>

<p>This tutorial is aimed at AI researchers who are interested in future research on trustworthiness of information. The goal of the tutorial is to present the audience with an exhaustive survey of relevant research on this topic and to outline future directions of research that may interest the AI community. No specific background knowledge is assumed of the audience.</p>

<h4><a name="ma4">MA4:</a> Maximum Satisfiability and Extensions</h4>
<p><b>Carlos Ans&oacute;tegui</b></p>

<p>The maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem is a generalization of the Satisfiability problem. The idea is that sometimes not all restrictions of a problem can be satisfied, and we try to satisfy the maximum number of them. The MaxSAT problem is a natural combinatorial optimization problem, and the technology developed for its resolution can be applied in several domains, such as: scheduling and timetabling problems, FPGA routing, software package installation, design debugging, bioinformatics, probabilistic reasoning, etc. In the last five years, state of the art MaxSAT solvers have experienced a significant advance and they can be applied on industrial problems.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will show how to encode optimization problems into MaxSAT. Then, we will study the algorithms behind successful MaxSAT solvers. In particular, we will emphasize algorithms and implementation details that give the best performance on industrial instances. We will also show how to apply other technologies from satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) and integer linear programming (ILP). Finally, we will introduce other extensions of MaxSAT and related problems such as the weighted SMT problem, the minimum satisfiability problem and the density of states of MaxSAT formulas. Introductory material on satisfiability will be included, so there is no prerequisite for participants.</p>

<h4><a name="mp1">MP1:</a> Automatically Improving Empirical Performance: Algorithm Configuration and Selection</h4>
<p><b>Frank Hutter, Lars Kotthoff, Yuri Malitsky, Barry O'Sullivan, and Lin Xu</b></p>

<p>Configurable algorithms for problem solving are ubiquitous in artificial intelligence. Configuring these algorithms, by finding good settings for their parameters, can make the difference between solving a problem quickly or taking hours to find the same solution. Similarly, different problem solving algorithms perform well on different types of instances, and the instance specific choice of which algorithm to use often has a similarly large impact as properly configuring the algorithm.</p>

<p>This four-hour tutorial discusses automated methods for identifying good parameter settings for problem solving algorithms (the algorithm configuration problem), for selecting the best algorithm on a per-instance basis (the algorithm selection problem), and for the combined problem of selecting the best setting of a configurable algorithm on a per-instance basis. It covers related techniques and touches on advanced topics. Case studies for SAT-based formal verification, mixed integer programming (MIP), supervised machine learning and others illustrate the results and show how to apply the techniques in practice.</p>

<p><b>Adriaan ter Mors</b></p>

<p>This four-hour tutorial will present both theoretical background and practically applicable algorithms on two interesting problems in the domain of coordinating agents moving in a shared environment that can be modeled as a graph. In multiagent pathfinding, algorithms must be capable of dealing with situations of extreme congestion, which means equal emphasis is placed on ensuring that each agent can reach its goal location and getting the agents there efficiently. Multiagent pathfinding has applications in, for example, video games, puzzling, and robotics.</p>

<p>Prioritized route planning, on the other hand, is not complete in general, (though completeness can be achieved with specific assumptions of the application domains), and focus of the research is on efficiency and robustness of route plans when executing in dynamic environments.

<h4><a name="mp4">MP4:</a> Semantic Web Rules: Fundamentals, Applications, and Standards</h4>
<p><b>Benjamin Grosof, Mike Dean and Michael Kifer</b></p>

<p>The area of semantic rules is perhaps the most important frontier today for the semantic web's core technology and standards. Recent progress includes major initial industry standards from W3C and OMG, and fundamental advances in the underlying knowledge representation techniques in declarative logic programs, including most recently for efficient higher-order defaults with sound integration of first order logic ontologies (OWL). Recent progress also includes methods to use rules for, or with, more expressive OWL ontologies; increasing integration of rules with query or search in SPARQL and relational databases; substantive translations between heterogeneous types of commercial rule engines; development of open-source tools for inferencing and interoperability; performance benchmarking of rule systems; a wide range of emerging applications including in business, science, and trust; and accelerating industry investments or acquisitions in the technology including by integrated software companies such as Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive and up to date introduction to these developments and to the fundamentals of the key technologies and outstanding research issues involved. It will explore example application scenarios, overall requirements and challenges, and touch upon business and social value and strategy considerations.</p>

<p>The area of semantic rules is perhaps the most important frontier today for the semantic web's core technology and standards. Rules extend databases and ontologies with more powerful, flexible, and active forms of structured knowledge (as opposed to unstructured knowledge such as text), and have a number of close relationships to other aspects of the overall semantic web such as ontologies, query or search, trust, and services. There are a number of exciting research issues, important initial standards from W3C and OMG have been completed, and major software companies such as Oracle are now supporting web rules functionality in their core products. Most semantic web researchers (and developers) are not yet up to speed in this area. This half-day tutorial will help them get there.</p>

<p>Most of the AAAI-13 audience, especially those interested in rules and their applications in semantic web, ontologies, querying of RDF and relational data, business on the web, services on the web. This includes researchers interested in core technologies, and developers interested in standards and applications, as well as those interested in closely related areas such as query, search, question answering, natural language processing, collective intelligence, ontologies, policies, trust, security, wikis, e-commerce, financial services, and biomedical. The tutorial will cater to those first learning about semantic web rules, as well as those who already have some background in them. It will assume only background knowledge of basics of logical knowledge representation: first order logic and relational DBMS; and basics of XML. Helpful also, but not absolutely required, are basics of RDF and OWL.</p>

He also is president of Benjamin Grosof &am; Associates, an expert consulting business on software technology and related strategy. Previously he was a senior research program manager at Vulcan Inc. (2007-2013), the asset management company of Paul G. Allen (cofounder of Microsoft). There he conceived and led a large research program in the area of rule-based semantic technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). Before Vulcan, he was an IT professor at MIT Sloan (2000-2007) and a senior software scientist at IBM Research (1988-2000). He has pioneered semantic technology and industry standards for rules; the combination of rules with ontologies; the application of rules in e-commerce, e-contracts, and policies; and the acquisition of rules and ontologies from natural language (NL). He cofounded the influential RuleML industry standards design effort and prototyped it in SweetRules, the main bases for the W3C Rule Interchange Format (RIF) standard. He cofounded the International Conference on Rules and Rule Markup Languages for the semantic web (which since became the RR and RuleML conferences).  He led the invention of several fundamental technical advances in knowledge representation, including courteous defeasibility, restraint bounded rationality, and the rule-based technique which rapidly became the currently dominant approach to commercial implementation of W3C OWL (Web Ontology Language) and the main basis of its RL (Rules Profile) standard. He also has extensive experience in machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and user interaction design. His background includes four major industry software releases, two years in software startups, a Stanford PhD, a Harvard BA, and over 50 refereed publications.</p>
