As the primary national conference on artificial intelligence, scientific research remains the primary focus of the conference. However, as the field of artificial intelligence matures, so should the conference. We are experimenting both with the form and the content to meet the changing needs.</p><p> We attempt to serve the scientific community by presenting a program which is both technical and practical in nature. AI-On-Line was introduced in 1990 to explore the current practice and the intellectual issues it raises. It will continue in 1991. </p><p>We are also pleased to announce the collocation of the Third Annual Conference on Innovative Applications in Anaheim. Holding these two prestigious events in the same location will afford attendees the opportunity of visiting both. Scientific participants can see how theory is employed within the real world, and practitioners will view current successes and innovations in AI science.</p><p> Artificial Intelligence continues to be both a fascinating and evolving field. We expect that AAAI-91 will reflect the energy and accomplishments during the past year.</p> <p class="right">Daniel G. Bobrow, <i>President, AAAI</i></p><hr /> <p>The themes of this year's conference are interaction and growth. Through a new conference format we have sought to encourage greater interaction among individual researchers and facilitate communication between diverse groups of researchers. The new format is designed to provide a more intimate atmosphere for researchers with similar interests. </p><p>Through a modified review process we have tried to identify and foster promising new research in its early stages. The result of the new reviewing procedures can be seen in a technical program that highlights new approaches and innovative techniques. </p><p>This year the conference is organized around several specialized forums each emphasizing a different set of coordinated topics. Each of these specialized forums features a schedule of presentations and meet-the-author sessions united by a set of related research issues. </p><p>Scheduling is arranged to encourage staying in one place for extended periods and seating is designed to facilitate note taking and audience participation. Time has been set aside to interact more closely with the authors in a poster session following each set of presentations. Conference participants may freely move between forums and are encouraged to participate in as many different forums as they have the time and inclination. The forum presentations are synchronized to simplify moving about. </p><p>The program committee has been encouraged to seek out and nurture groundbreaking research that is perhaps still in early stages. We want to change the view that the purpose of the proceedings of the national conference on artificial intelligence is archival and that the program committee only accepts papers describing results in well-established programs of research. We also sought to identify papers with a more balanced blend of theory and practice. </p><p>The program committee was selected with both these thoughts in mind. The conference format is designed to facilitate the exploration of new directions for research and to allow for interaction between the theoretically and the empirically oriented.</p><p class="right"><i>Thomas Dean and Kathy McKeown</i></p><hr /><p>For more information about AAAI&ndash;91, please consult the following:</p><ul><li><a href="../../Press/Proceedings/aaai91.php">Conference proceedings.</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai91contents.php">List of papers</a> (with links to abstracts) presented at the conference.</li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/1991/aaai91call.pdf"> Call for papers</a> (PDF).</li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/1991/aaai91program.pdf">Conference program</a> (PDF).</li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/1991/aaai91bestpaper.pdf">Best paper award</a> (PDF).</li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/1991/aaai91brochure.pdf">Conference registration brochure.</a> (PDF)</li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/1991/aaai91aionline.pdf"> AI-on-Line</a> (PDF).</li><li><a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/1991/aaai91committee.pdf">Conference organizers and program committee.</a> (PDF)</li></ul></div></div></div><div id="left">
