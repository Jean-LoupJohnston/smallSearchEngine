<p>
The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and scientific exchange among AI researchers, practitioners, scientists, students and engineers in AI and all affiliated disciplines. AAAI-15 is the Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. It will continue the traditions of previous AAAI conferences with multiple technical tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, student abstracts, senior member papers, poster sessions, a video competition, and exhibit programs, all selected according to the highest standards. AAAI-15, as the inaugural Winter AAAI conference, will also include special programs that celebrate the past and look into the future. A number of exciting innovations are planned, including additional programs for students and young researchers.
</p>


<h4 class="text2">Innovations for the Main Conference Track</h4>

<ul>
<li><i>Resubmissions of Substantially Improved AAAI-14 Submissions:</i> AAAI-15 expects to have a mechanism for authors to submit substantially improved versions of their declined AAAI-14 submissions together with a cover letter that explains how their revised submissions address the comments of the reviewers. The cover letters will be taken into consideration in the review process. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2015/aaai15improved.php">(Details)</a></li>

<li><i>Demonstrations:</i> During paper submission, authors will be able to express interest in demonstrating their systems (if applicable) during a demonstration/poster session and describe the features of their intended demonstration.</li>

<li><i>Easily Accessible Papers:</i> AAAI-15 is interested in identifying a small number of papers that make good reading material for people with a general background knowledge of artificial intelligence but no detailed knowledge of the subarea covered in the paper. Authors of such papers will meet at AAAI-15 with students interested in their papers. <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2015/aaai15accessible.php">(Details)</a></li>

<li><i>Special Tracks:</i> AAAI-15 will include several special paper tracks (listed below) on focused topics to increase participation in special areas of interest.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<div class="hr1">

</div>

<h4 class="text2">Author Registration</h4>

<p>
Authors must register at the <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aaai15">AAAI-15 web-based technical track paper submission site</a> before they submit their abstracts and papers. (Please note there is a <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aaai15intsystrack" rel="nofollow">separate submission track</a> for the Integrated Systems Track.) The software will assign a password, which will enable the author to log on to submit an abstract and paper. To avoid network problems in the last minute rush, authors are strongly encouraged to register as soon as possible after May 1, well in advance of the September 10 abstract deadline.
</p>


<ul>
<li>Registration will close at 11:59 PM PST on September 10, 2014.</li>
<li>Abstract submission will close at 11:59 PM PST on September 10, 2014.</li>
<li>Final paper submission will close at 11:59 PM PST on September 15, 2014.</li>
</ul>


<h4 class="text2">Abstract and Paper Submission</h4>

<p>
Papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style; see the author instruction page for details. Papers must be in trouble-free, high-resolution PDF format, formatted for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts. Submitted papers may be no longer than 7 pages with page 7 containing nothing but references. Submitted papers are not required to contain the copyright block, and acknowledgements should not be included due to blind review. Please also refer to the instructions on how to prepare your paper for blind review. For final papers, authors may buy up to two additional pages in the proceedings (see below for details). The last page of final papers may contain text other than the references and acknowledgements, but all references in the submitted paper should appear in the final version except for superseded references. Final papers must contain the copyright block.
</p>


<h4 class="text2">Supplemental Materials</h4>

<p>
The length of the main submission is strictly limited as indicated above. However, authors may also choose to submit supplemental material as an attachment. Examples of supplemental material are proofs of theorems that are stated in the main paper, or video demonstrations. Authors may reference the supplemental material in their papers. However, please note that there is no guarantee that the reviewers will review the supplemental material. Authors are advised to make sure the paper is self-contained. If the proofs are an important part of the contribution, then they should at least be summarized in the main paper. Similarly, the video demonstration may be described in the body of the paper. Reviewers will view the material at their own discretion. IMPORTANT: please be very careful not to violate the blind review requirements in the supplemental material.
</p>

<p>
Electronic abstract and paper submission through the AAAI-15 paper submission site is required on or (preferably) before the deadline dates listed above. We cannot accept submissions by e-mail or fax. Authors will receive confirmation of receipt of their abstracts or papers, including an ID number, shortly after submission. AAAI will contact authors again only if problems are encountered with papers. Inquiries regarding paper receipt must be made no later than September 22, 2014.
</p>

<h4 class="text2">Blind Review Instructions</h4>

<p>
Reviewing for the AAAI Conference is blind to the identities of the authors. The first page, on which the paper body begins, should include the title, abstract, content areas, and ID number (if available), but not the acknowledgments and names or affiliations of the authors. The references should include all published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, but should not include unpublished works. Submissions should not contain pointers to supplemental material on the web because authors will be allowed to submit a supplemental file via EasyChair at the time of the paper submission.
</p>

<p>
When referring to one's own work, use the third person, rather than the first person. For example, say "Previously, Newell (1996) has shown that...," rather than "In our previous work (Newell 1996) we have shown that...." Try to avoid including any information in the body of the paper or references that would identify the authors or their institutions. Such information may be added to the final camera-ready version for publication.
</p>


<h4 class="text2">Policy Concerning Submissions to Other Conferences or Journals</h4>

<p>
AAAI-15 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during AAAI's review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. The restrictions also do not apply to preprints posted only on arXiv. Authors will be required to confirm that their submissions conform to these requirements at the time of submission.
</p>


<h4 class="text2">Review Process</h4>

<p>
Program committee members will identify papers they are qualified to review based on the information submitted electronically (the paper's title, keywords, and abstract). Their reviewing will be done blind to the identities of the authors and their institutions. Authors will have a limited opportunity to respond to initial reviews. This author feedback will then be taken into account in the final recommendations and reviews may be changed accordingly. The program committee's reviews will make recommendations to the senior program committee, which in turn will make recommendations to the program cochairs. The program cochairs will make all final decisions following full consultation with members of the senior program committee during this process.
</p>


<h4 class="text2">Publication</h4>

<p>
Accepted papers will be allocated seven (7) pages in the conference proceedings; up to two (2) additional pages may be used at a cost to the authors of $275 per page. Final papers found to exceed page limits and or otherwise violating the instructions to authors will not be included in the proceedings. Authors will be required to transfer copyright of their paper to AAAI. The proceedings will be available in the AAAI Digital Library at the conference, and will also be available in hard copy after the conference.
</p>


<h4 class="text2">Journal Opportunities</h4>

<p>
Papers that receive excellent reviews may be selected for fast track reviewing at participating journals, including the <i>AI Journal</i> (AIJ) and the <i>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</i> (JAIR). Eligible authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their AAAI-15 papers to the journal of their choice.
</p>

<p>
The <i>AI Journal</i> offers fast-track publication to the authors of selected excellent papers as determined by the Program Committee of AAAI-15. They aim at a review process of about 6 weeks. The papers, which should conform to all currently posted requirements relating to the submission of AIJ papers posted on the Elsevier and AI Journal sites would be published as regular papers but identified as revisions of papers first given at AAAI-15.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research</i> has a special track for award winning papers from prestigious conferences. The purpose is to highlight the research reflected in them and to give the authors a chance to expand their submission, including more details. The papers will get an expedited review process, and accepted papers receive special recognition on the JAIR page.
</p>
