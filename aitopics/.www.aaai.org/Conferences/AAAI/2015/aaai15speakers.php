<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Bagnell">AAAI-15 Invited Talk</a></i><br />
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics: Interplay and Interaction
</h3>

<p><b>Drew Bagnell (Carnegie Mellon University)</b></p>

<p>
My talk will focus on theoretical and algorithmic ideas in machine learning and AI, and their origin in problems of robotics. Much of my talk will focus on no-regret online learning methods in machine learning and the critical role of interaction for learning in robotics.
</p>

<p>
I will highlight the tremendous impact robotics has had in identifying key learning problems and suggesting algorithmic techniques; additionally, I'll consider the remarkable tools that have been developed within AI and learning to address hard robotics problems. I'll discuss a variety of machine learning techniques of increasing sophistication from the most familiar classification problems, to structured prediction, and to imitation learning. I will also address how to make reinforcement learning and learning control practical in robotics.
Throughout, we will look at case studies in learning dexterous manipulation, activity forecasting of drivers and pedestrians, and imitation learning of robotic locomotion and rough-terrain navigation. These case studies highlight key challenges in applying AI and learning algorithms in practical settings.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Sellmann">AAAI-15 Invited Talk</a></i><br />Intelligent Decisions
</h3>

<p><b>Meinolf Sellmann (IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center)</b></p>

<p>At its best intelligence creates aesthetic and beauty, yet from a utilitarian perspective intelligence primarily serves the purpose of making better decisions. Today's prescriptive decision support systems are most effective when applied to specific recurring operational problems. Recent advances in AI technology have revived the vision of commercially viable cooperative strategic decision support systems. These cognitive systems integrate information retrieval, knowledge representation, interactive modelling, as well as social and self-learning capabilities with logic reasoning and probabilistic decision making under uncertainty. I provide a snapshot of the current technology status by showcasing several projects that ultimately aim at intelligent human-in-the-loop decision making.</p>

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Getoor">AAAI-15 Invited Talk</a></i><br />
Using Statistics and Semantics to Solve Big (Graph) Data Problems</h3>

<p><b>Lise Getoor (University of California, Santa Cruz)</b></p>

<p>
Big data problems benefit from modeling both structure and uncertainty, so there is a growing need for tools to develop large, complex probabilistic models. These tools should combine high-level knowledge representation with general purpose, scalable algorithms for learning and inference. In this talk, I will survey some of the recent work from the statistical relational learning community on learning and inference in richly-structured, multi-relational network data. I will highlight both important developments and opportunities in which ideas from AI can have great impact on upcoming challenges within the machine learning, data science and data mining communities.

<h3 class="text2"><i><a name="Bowling">AAAI-15 Invited Talk</a></i><br />
von Neumann's Dream</h3>

<p><b>Michael Bowling (University of Alberta)</b></p>

<p>
Chess has long served as the measure of progress for artificial intelligence. However, at the very beginning of computing and artificial intelligence, John von Neumann dreamt of a different game: "Real life is not like [chess]. Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory." The game von Neumann hinted at is poker, and it played a foundational role in his formalization of game theory. Shortly after launching the field of game theory, he practically abandoned his new discipline to focus on the budding field of computing. He saw computers as the way to make his mathematics workable. Now, over 70 years later with both significant advances in computing and game theoretic algorithms, von Neumann's dream is now a reality. Heads-up limit Texas hold'em poker, the smallest variant of poker played by humans, is essentially solved. In this talk, I will discuss how we accomplished this landmark result, along with the substantial scientific advances in our failed attempts along the way.

<p><img src="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2015/Photos/bowling.jpg" alt="Michael Bowling" width="59" height="75" class="img1" />
Michael Bowling is a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta. His research focuses on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and game theory; and he is particularly fascinated by the problem of how computers can learn to play games through experience. Bowling is the leader of the Computer Poker Research Group, which has built some of the strongest poker playing programs in the world. In 2008, one of these programs, Polaris, defeated a team of top professional poker players in two-player, limit Texas Hold'em, becoming the first program to defeat poker pros in a meaningful competition.  His research has been featured on the television programs <i>Scientific American Frontiers, National Geographic Today,</i> and <i>Discovery Channel Canada;</i> in the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Wired;</i> and twice in exhibits at the Smithsonian Museums in Washington, D.C.
