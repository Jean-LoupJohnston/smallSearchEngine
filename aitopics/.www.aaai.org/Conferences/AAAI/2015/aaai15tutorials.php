A Beginner's Introduction to Heuristic Search Planning</h3>
<p><b>
Malte Helmert and Gabriele R&ouml;ger</b></p>

<p>
Classical planning is a traditional area of AI interested in general problem solving: developing a single algorithm to find the best actions for an agent to execute in all possible environments that fit within the scope of the planning algorithm's modeling language. The tutorial is aimed at starting AI researchers with little or no previous familiarity with the research area of automated planning.
</p>

<p>
We introduce the problem of classical planning, explain its place within the wider AI research area, and discuss the foundational techniques underlying most state-of-the-art planning algorithms. The emphasis is on planning as heuristic search, where the challenge is to derive accurate search heuristics for a problem domain without human intervention, given only a declarative problem description. We explain the major ideas underlying today's search heuristics and present some concrete examples in depth.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial includes hands-on demonstrations and shows how to implement new search heuristics in the state-of-the-art Fast Downward planning system.
</p>

<p>
<i>Prerequisites:</i> We only assume knowledge of AI basics, such as familiarity with basic formal logic notations and with the greedy best-first search and A* search algorithms.

Natural Language Processing in Watson</h3>
<p><b>
James Fan and Ken Barker</b></p>

<p>
Open domain question answering (QA) is a longstanding research problem. Recently, IBM took on this challenge in the context of <i>Jeopardy!,</i> a well-known TV quiz show that has been airing on television in the United States for more than 25 years. The game  pits three human contestants against one another in a competition that requires answering rich natural language questions over a very broad domain of topics. The development of a system able to compete to grand champions in the <i>Jeopardy!</i> challenge led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. The DeepQA project shapes a grand challenge in computer science that aims to illustrate how the wide and growing accessibility of natural language content and the integration and advancement of natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, and massively parallel computation can drive open-domain automatic question answering technology to a point where it clearly and consistently rivals the best human performance. Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in the overall deep QA architecture. It allows to "make sense" of both question and unstructured knowledge contained in the large corpora where most of the answers are located. That's why we decided to focus this tutorial on the NLP technology adopted by Watson and on how it fits in the general Deep QA architecture.

Neuroevolution Reinforcement Learning</h3>
<p><b>
Risto Miikkulainen</b></p>

<p>
In this four-hour tutorial, neuroevolution RL will first be motivated and compared with value-function RL, and neuroevolution is shown to be strong in domains with large state and action spaces and where the state of the world is not fully known. Basic neuroevolution techniques will be reviewed and illustrated with state of the art applications in robotics, game playing, intelligent agents, and multiagent systems. Future opportunities will then be reviewed, focusing in particular on the generative and developmental approaches to neuroevolution, and applications in games and robotics, art and design, and cognitive science.

Probabilistic Programming with Figaro</h3>
<p><b>
Avi Pfeffer and Brian Ruttenberg</b></p>

<p>
This full day tutorial is an in-depth and interactive introduction to probabilistic programming, which allows probabilistic processes, models and algorithms to be specified using familiar programming language constructs. These languages are democratizing the AI field, enabling even users with little ML and AI experience to easily construct and perform inference on large and complex probabilistic models. The first half of the tutorial will present an overview and history of probabilistic programming, an explanation of how to use probabilistic programming to represent a variety of models, and an explanation of inference and learning algorithms used in probabilistic programming, including the advantages and disadvantages of each and their suitability to different tasks. The second half of the tutorial will be a hands-on, interactive introduction to using probabilistic programming for practical applications. Participants will solve a sequence of real-world problems using the open source Figaro PP system. Due to the mathematical nature of probabilistic programming, participants will be expected to have existing knowledge in calculus and comfort with basic concepts related to working with probabilities and statistics.

Computing Game-Theoretic Solutions</h3>
<p><b>
Vincent Conitzer</b></p>

<p>
Game theory concerns how to form beliefs and act in settings with multiple self-interested agents. The best-known solution concept in game theory is that of Nash equilibrium. But there are also others, such as correlated equilibrium and Stackelberg mixed strategies. The latter concept offers a number of conceptual and computational advantages and has recently been deployed in a number of real-world security domains. I will review these concepts as well as algorithms for computing their solutions. I will also discuss learning in games. No previous background in game theory will be required.

Human-in-the-Loop Planning and Decision Support</h3>
<p><b>
Subbarao Kambhampati and Kartik Talamadupula</b></p>

<p>
Endowing an automated agent with the ability to "plan" &mdash; that is, converting its high-level goals into an executable course of action &mdash; has been a long-standing quest in AI. For much of the history of automated planning, the dominant research theme has been efficient synthesis of plans under increasingly expressive system dynamics (classical, temporal, stochastic, and so on).
</p>

<p>
An implicit assumption underlying this research has been that the planner's responsibilities start with taking a complete specification, and end with giving out a complete course of action. This assumption is no longer valid when humans are part of the decision making loop, as is the case in an increasing number of decision support and human-machine teaming scenarios.
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial, we will identify the research challenges in human-in-the-loop planning, including the need to interpret the goals/intentions of the humans in the loop, the need to support continual planning and replanning, the need to unobtrusively support team-decision making, and above all the need to handle pervasive incompleteness in the domain models as well as problem specification. We will then survey current solutions to these problems grounded in the context of human-robot teaming, decision support systems and crowd-sourced planning.

AI for Smarter Cities. Hype or Reality? A Study in Dublin, Bologna, Miami, and Rio</h3>
<p><b>
Pascal Hitzler, Freddy Lecue, Raghava Mutharaju, Jeff Z. Pan, and Jiewen Wu</b></p>

<p>
Cities take more and more advantages of information and communications technology (ICT) to better manage their resources and improve the quality of life of its citizens. ICT spans many departments of the cities, from transportation, water, energy to building management and social-care services. AI techniques are getting more and more attraction from cities to represent and organize information, maintain sustainable networks, predict incidents, optimize distribution, diagnose faults, plan routes and organize their infrastructure. Managing traffic efficiently, among many other domains in cities, is one of the key issues in large cities. In the first part of the tutorial, we describe the domains of applications which could benefit from AI techniques, along with introducing the necessary background knowledge. Then we focus on traffic applications, which make use of recent AI research in knowledge representation, logic programming, machine learning, planning, reasoning and optimization. Specifically we go through the next version of scalable AI driven traffic related application where (1) data from a variety of sources is collected, (2) knowledge about traffic, vehicles, citizens, events is represented and (ii) deductive and inductive reasoning is combined for diagnosing and predicting road traffic congestion. Based on these principles, a real-time, publicly available AI system named STAR-CITY was developed. We discuss the results of deploying STAR-CITY, and its related AI technologies in cities such as Dublin, Bologna, Miami, Rio and the lessons learned. The final part of the tutorial aims at discussing future AI opportunities including scalability issues for large cities.

Constraint-Based Temporal Reasoning</h3>
<p><b>
Roman Bart&aacute;k, Robert A. Morris, and K. Brent Venable</b></p>

<p>
The representation of temporal information, and reasoning about time, are important in artificial intelligence. Reasoning about time plays a critical role in building automated planning and scheduling systems, where causal and temporal relations are the most critical concepts. The tutorial introduces to core concepts of constraint-based temporal reasoning. In particular, it will describe the classical temporal models, both qualitative and quantitative, and relevant reasoning (consistency) techniques, and it will cover extensions of these models towards representing preferences and uncertainty. Example applications will also be listed.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial is targeted especially to PhD students and researchers that need to employ temporal reasoning in their systems. No specific prior knowledge is required beyond the basic understanding of logic and algorithms.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial is based on <i>An Introduction to Constraint-Based Temporal Reasoning</i> published by Morgan &amp; Claypool.

Submodularity in Machine Learning Applications</h3>
<p><b>
Jeff Bilmes</b></p>

<p>
Submodular functions are receiving increasing attention in the machine learning community owing to their natural and wide ranging applicability and also to their attractive computational properties. In this tutorial, our goal will be to get a good intuitive sense for what submodular functions are and where they can be usefully applied. We will start by defining submodularity and polymatroidality &mdash; we will survey a surprisingly diverse set of functions that are submodular and operations that (sometimes remarkably) preserve submodularity. We'll also define a class of combinatorial optimization problems that use submodularity, and briefly discuss their complexities, and how the submodularity property is what makes the problems approximable in polynomial time. Next, we'll discuss how submodularity is applied in machine learning. We will see how
submodularity can be a useful model of diversity, coverage, and information, and how this can help applications such as document and image summarization, feature selection, data subset selection and sensor placement, and social network influence and viral marketing. We'll also learn how submodularity is a good model for roughness,
cooperatively interacting costs, and complexity, and how this can help applications such as image segmentation in computer vision, inference in high tree-width graphical models, structured convex norms and regularizers, and active / semisupervised learning.</p>

Artificial Intelligence and Technological Unemployment</h3>
<p><b>
Moshe Vardi</b></p>

<p>
Over the past decades years artificial intelligence (AI) has made a remarkable progress. While AI has been proven to be much more difficult than believed by its early pioneers, its inexorable progress over the past 50 years suggests that H. Simon was probably right when he wrote in 1956 "machines will be capable ... of doing any work a man can do." We are now forced to consider the possibility that further progress in AI may be the cause of technological unemployment, which is unemployment caused by technological change. I do not expect this to happen in the very near future, but I do believe that by 2045 machines will be able to do if not any work that humans can do, then, at least, a very significant fraction of the work that humans can do. The following question, therefore, seems to be of paramount importance. If machines are capable of doing almost any work humans can do, what will humans do?
</p>

<p>
In this tutorial, I will review the debate about technological unemployment, from the Luddites in the 19th century to the Neo-Luddites of the 21st century. I will then discuss the societal impact of technological unemployment and their ethical dimensions.

Generalizing Optimization to Equilibration: A New Foundation for AI in the 21st Century</h3>
<p><b>
Sridhar Mahadevan</b></p>

<p>
Much work in AI -from machine learning and natural language processing, to planning, perception, and robotics - is based on optimization. While this foundation has proved useful, the rapidly changing nature of computation and data, may limit the success of classical optimization, as data is increasingly stored heterogeneously in the "cloud", and "crowd" and "cloud" based computation requires balancing multiple competing objectives, such as privacy, reliability and security, across heterogeneous computational actors. The aim of this tutorial is to present a new theoretical foundation for AI, based on a framework called equilibration that elegantly generalizes optimization. The equilibration framework is based on the mathematical formalisms of variational inequalities (VIs) and projected dynamical systems (PDS). Finite-dimensional VIs generalize (convex) optimization, and unifies many disparate areas of significant practical importance, ranging from equilibrium problems in economics, game theory, evolutionary dynamics, linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, network and traffic flow, saddle-point problems, and solutions of nonlinear equations. PDS yield a powerful microscope to examine the dynamic processes that lead to equilibria. The goals of the proposed tutorial are to present the mathematical formalisms of VIs and PDS, and show their utility in diverse practical applications of AI of growing importance in the 21st century.

Semantic Parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammars</h3>
<p><b>
Yoav Artzi, Nicholas FitzGerald, and Luke Zettlemoyer</b></p>

<p>
Semantic parsers map natural language sentences to formal representations of their underlying meaning. Building accurate semantic parsers without prohibitive engineering costs is a long-standing, open research problem. This tutorial will describe general principles for building semantic parsers.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial will be divided into two parts: learning and modeling. In the learning part, we will describe a unified approach for learning combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) semantic parsers that induces both a lexicon and parsing parameters. The approach learns from data with labeled meaning representations, as well as from more easily gathered weak supervision. It also enables grounded learning where the semantic parser is used in an interactive environment, for example to read and execute instructions. The modeling section will include best practices for grammar design and choice of semantic representation. We will motivate our use of lambda calculus for building and representing meaning with examples from several domains.
</p>

<p>
The ideas we will discuss are widely applicable. The semantic modeling approach, while implemented in lambda calculus, is applicable to many other formal languages. Similarly, the algorithms for inducing CCG focus on tasks that are formalism independent: learning the meaning of words and estimating parsing parameters. No prior knowledge of CCG is required.

Voting Rules for AI</h3>
<p><b>
Toby Walsh, K. Brent Venable, and Francesca Rossi</b></p>

<p>
Voting rules are increasingly being used in many AI settings, from multiagent systems to ensemble methods, from decision making to sentiment analysis, from crowdsourcing to human computation.
</p>

<p>
To use such rules effectively, it is important to take into account their properties, as well as a number of deep normative results about their behaviour. Fortunately, researchers in social choice have been studying such issues for many years. In this tutorial we will introduce several voting rules and compare them according to their properties. We will also show several examples of their use in various AI scenarios. No previous knowledge of social choice is needed. The tutorial can be appreciated by any AI researcher.
