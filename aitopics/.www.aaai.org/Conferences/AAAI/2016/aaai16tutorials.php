CP-Nets</h3>
<p><b>Thomas E. Allen, Judy Goldsmith, and Francesca Rossi</b></p>

<p>Conditional preference networks (CP-nets) are a compact and intuitive representation of preferences. They provide a modelling and reasoning tool for conditional qualitative preferences. Combinatorial preference domains abound, and CP-nets have a wide range of interesting and important applications, including automated negotiation, interest-matching in social networks, cybersecurity, and as aggregation primitives for making group decisions.</p>
<p>It is known that certain reasoning tasks, in particular that of dominance (for example, given a CP-net N and two outcomes or items, which if either is preferred according to N?), are computationally complex &mdash; NP-hard or worse. However, there is a growing base of heuristic algorithms for dominance testing. This bolsters the case for more widespread use of CP-nets in practice. In this tutorial we hope to introduce participants to CP-nets and methods for using them. </p>
<p>Those familiar with preference representations will be interested in our demonstration of a new GUI for visualizing CP-nets, recent approaches to dominance testing, an algorithm to generate CP-nets i.i.d., and results of extensive human-subjects experiments. </p>
<p>We expect participants to complete the session with an increased appreciation for the usefulness and usability of CP-nets. </p>

Organ Exchanges: A Success Story of AI in Healthcare</h3>
<p><b>John Dickerson and Tuomas Sandholm</b></p>

<p>This tutorial covers past and current research in organ exchange, a method by which patients in need of a organ can swap willing but incompatible donors. Throughout, it also gives a higher-level overview of the steps taken to translate a purely academic idea into a large fielded healthcare system. The tutorial focuses on the computational aspects of organ exchange, starting by introducing past research that has now been implemented in real-world kidney exchange (or deemed impractical and not yet fielded) and then by covering the current research problems available at the intersection of AI, optimization, and economics. It especially dives into the computational methods developed and used to solve extremely large discrete optimization problems that reflect kidney exchange, along with the interplay between modeling decisions, computational tractability, exchange efficiency, equity, dynamism in matching, and a variety of other real-world constraints and considerations. While we focus on kidney exchange, research toward exchanges for other organs such as livers and lungs, as well as cross-organ exchanges, will also be covered.</p>
<p>This tutorial will be accessible to the general attendee of AAAI and should not require specialized knowledge in a specific subfield of AI.</p>

Recent Directions in Heuristic-Search</h3>
<p><b>Ariel Felner, Wheeler Ruml, and Nathan Sturtevant</b></p>

<p>Heuristic state-space search is a fundamental technique in AI and virtually every AI class includes A* and IDA*. But what more advanced topics should be included? What is exciting in heuristic search today? This tutorial provides overviews of important results in three areas within heuristic search that have seen recent progress, presented by researchers active in those areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Optimal search. This topic has always been at the core of this field.</li>
	<li>Suboptimal search. Since it can require significant time and memory to prove that a solution is optimal, many applications can benefit from search algorithms that optimize a different objective.</li>
	<li>Search in explicit domains. Problems such as grid pathfinding can be very challenging under tight time, memory, or solution constraints.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, we aim to look at a broad range of approaches, search scenarios and recent understandings. We will highlight the different characteristics of different search problems, and identify areas that have not been well-explored.</p>
<p>We assume that participants are familiar with the basics of state-space search (for example, the A* algorithm and admissible heuristics).</p>

Symbolic Methods for Hybrid Inference, Optimization, and Decision-Making</h3>
<p><b>Scott Sanner</b></p>

<p>To date, our ability to perform exact closed-form inference or optimization in hybrid domains (that is, containing mixed discrete and continuous variables) is largely limited to special well-behaved cases. This tutorial argues that with an appropriate representation and data structure, we can vastly expand the class of models for which we can perform exact, closed-form inference.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I review the algebraic decision diagram (ADD) and introduce an extension to continuous variables &mdash; termed the extended ADD (XADD) &mdash; to represent arbitrary piecewise functions over discrete and continuous variables and show how to efficiently compute elementary arithmetic operations, integrals, and maximization for these functions. Then I cover a wide range of novel applications where the XADD may be applied: (1) exact learning and inference in expressive discrete and continuous variable graphical models, (2) factored, parameterized linear and quadratic optimization, and (3) exact solutions to continuous state, action, and observation MDPs and POMDPs.</p>

AI for Disasters</h3>
<p><b>Robin R. Murphy</b></p>
<p><i>(1 hour, 45 minutes)</i></p>
<p>The goal of the tutorial is to enable researchers in all areas of artificial intelligence to determine how their research might apply to disaster response and recovery. Participants will be presented with a domain theory of disasters from an informatics perspective and the opportunities for artificial intelligence. The domain theory will introduce the organization of disaster responses and recovery operations, the difference between disaster response and recovery and disaster relief, the phases of a disaster and decisions made by the stakeholders during each phase, the spatial distribution of stakeholders, and the roles of formal and informal stakeholders, especially their information needs. The tutorial will concentrate on the current state of the practice impacting the design of intelligent systems, notably responder access to computing and networking resources, the three emerging sources of data overload (mobile devices, UAVs, and social networks), commonly used decision support tools and visualization packages, constraints on informatics: environmental, connectivity, costs, regulatory including privacy and public accountability, and recommendations on working with emergency professionals Researchers will be better able to converse with emergency professionals and establish relationships.</p>

Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories</h3>
<p><b>Joohyung Lee</b></p>
<p><i>(1 hour, 45 minutes)</i></p>

<p>Answer set programming (ASP) is a successful declarative programming method oriented towards solving combinatorial and knowledge intensive problems. It has well-developed foundations, efficient reasoning systems, and a methodology of use tested on a number of industrial applications. The relationship between ASP and propositional satisfiability (SAT) has led to a method of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted from SAT.</p>
<p>Some recent extensions of ASP are to overcome the propositional setting of ASP by extending its mathematical foundation and integrating ASP with other computing paradigms. The tutorial will cover "Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories," which tightly integrates ASP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), thereby overcoming some of the computational limitations of ASP and some of the modeling limitations of SMT. A high level action language based on ASPMT allows for succinct representation of hybrid transition systems, where discrete changes and continuous changes coexist. In a broader sense, ASPMT covers an extension of ASP combined with any external computation sources.</p>
<p>The target audience is those who are interested in declarative problem solving methods, recent developments in ASP and SMT, and their relations. Basic knowledge of first-order logic will be assumed, but no prior knowledge of ASP and SMT is required.</p>

Deep Learning: from Foundations to Implementation</h3>
<p><b>Reza Borhani, Jeremy Watt and Aggelos K. Katsaggelos</b></p>

<p>Due to their wide applicability, the tools of Deep Learning have quickly become some of the most important for today's researchers in computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and related fields. However understanding the foundations of deep learning can be intimidating to the uninitiated, as can comprehending the details of their implementation which demands an understanding of numerical optimization often unfamiliar to those with a traditional computer science or engineering background. In this tutorial we provide a user-friendly introduction to the basic tools of deep learning, describe their many applications, discuss how they relate to more traditional ideas in machine learning, and provide an introduction to most useful techniques from numerical optimization crucial to their implementation. These include an overview of essential concepts from nonlinear programming, stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation, greedy techniques, as well as regularization and momentum methods. To make full use of this tutorial one only needs a basic understanding of linear algebra and vector calculus. No prior knowledge of numerical optimization or machine learning is expected. Since all the demos in this tutorial are implemented in Python/Matlab, familiarity with the syntax of either of these languages is a plus as we intend to provide the code for all the algorithms presented in this talk.</p>

Type-Based Methods for Interaction in Multiagent Systems</h3>
<p><b>Stefano Albrecht and Prashant Doshi</b></p>

<p>Inter-agent interactions are fundamental to a wide range of research in AI. A method for modeling interactions that is receiving much interest over the past decade in AI is to reason about the interaction using a space of predefined behaviours. Specifically, in the absence of knowing the true behaviour of the other agent, the approach supposes that the other agents' behaviours are drawn from a set of known or hypothesised behaviours, and to decide the agent's own actions in expectation of these dynamic types which may change as the agents act and observe. We refer to a private and sufficient abstraction of a hypothesised behaviour as a type.</p>
<p>This idea has been studied extensively in economics by game theorists and investigated in preliminary ways by sub-groups in AI for game playing and planning. Preliminary outcomes emphatically suggest that reasoning about types is an important tool for solving problems involving interactions with high uncertainty about agent behaviours and in which online learning based on trial-and-error is undesirable or infeasible. This half-day tutorial will provide a comprehensive and unified introduction to the theory and practice of type-based methods spanning early research in game theory to the latest work in AI, as well as outlining open problems for future research. The tutorial requires no prior knowledge of multiagent theory but assumes familiarity with basic probability and statistics.</p>

Constraint (Logic) Programming</h3>
<p><b>Roman Bart&aacute;k</b></p>

<p>Constraint logic programming (CLP) is a natural extension of logic programming, where unification is generalized to constraint satisfaction. Hence Prolog can be seen as one of the most suitable host languages for constraint programming.</p>
<p>This tutorial explains mainstream constraint satisfaction techniques and shows how they influence problem modeling in the context of logic programming. The core notions of constraint consistency, in particular arc consistency will be explained together with major consistency algorithms. The notion of a global constraint will also be explained and demonstrated with examples. After that we will show how consistency techniques can be integrated with search to obtain a complete constraint solver. In the second part, the tutorial will focus on modeling examples. It will show how to model problems using constraint logic programming. We will discuss some modeling rules and show how to improve efficiency of constraint programs.</p>
<p>The tutorial is targeted mainly to students and researchers interested in declarative programming techniques for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as planning, scheduling, routing, configuration etc. No prior knowledge of constraint programming is required; the tutorial only assumes basic understanding of Prolog programming.</p>

How to Automatically Machine Read the Web</h3>
<p><b>Estevam Rafael Hruschka Junior</b></p>

<p>The web is inundated with information in many different formats including semi-structured and unstructured data. Machine Reading is a research area aiming to build systems that can read natural-language-based information, extracting knowledge and storing it into (structured) knowledge bases. In this tutorial the idea of automatically reading the web using machine reading techniques will be explored. Four of the most successful machine reading approaches intended to read the web (namely DBPedia, Yago, OIE (Open Information Extraction) and NELL) will be presented and discussed. Principles, subtleties, as well as current results of each approach will be addressed. On-line resources (from each approach) will be explored and the future directions in each project will be pointed out. In spite of mainly focusing on the four aforementioned projects, some other independent contributions on machine reading the web will be mentioned and pointed out as related works, as well as two other industrial projects, namely Google Knowledge Vault and IBM Watson.</p>
<p>The tutorial is intended to prepare the attendees to start new research works in this area, as well as to get to know about the state-of-the-art, the main challenges, and some of the most promising future directions, as well as available resources.</p>

Algorithm Configuration: A Hands on Tutorial</h3>
<p><b>Frank Hutter and T. Marius Lindauer</b></p>

<p>Algorithms with free parameters abound in AI and beyond, and the setting of these parameters often makes the difference between failing to solve a problem and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Since manual parameter tuning is tedious and time-consuming, in recent years, general methods for solving this algorithm con figuration problem have been developed in the AI literature, based on various principles from machine learning, statistics, and optimization. By now there exist many success stories of algorithm con guration, for both hard combinatorial problems (for example, SAT solving, AI planning, mixed integer programming, time tabling, etc) and supervised machine learning (for example, Auto-WEKA, auto-sklearn, and parameter tuning in deep learning).</p>
<p>In this hands-on tutorial, we will demonstrate how to effectively use algorithm con guration in practice. Attendees do not require any specialized knowledge and will walk away with hands-on experience in con figuring various algorithms that will allow them to apply algorithm con guration in their respective fields of research.</p>

Algorithms for Maximum Satisfiability with Applications to AI</h3>
<p><b>Fahiem Bacchus and Matti J&atilde;rvisalo</b></p>

<p>Many important AI problems involve an optimization component. Maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) is an optimization version of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) that can be applied to a variety of optimization problems that arise in AI. From a simple propositional encoding one can automatically achieve a working optimizer for your application by using a MaxSAT solver. This can be much less time consuming than building a custom solution to one's optimization problem. In fact, a well engineered MaxSAT solver can often be more efficient than a custom solution. MaxSAT also offers an alternative to integer programming (IP) in many AI applications. In this tutorial we will
introduce MaxSAT, give an overview of the different techniques have been developed for solving MaxSAT (with a focus on which techniques tend to be more effective on which types of problems), and explain via case studies how MaxSAT has been used to solve problems from different areas of AI. After this tutorial you should be better equipped to assess whether or not MaxSAT would be useful in your work and better able to use modern MaxSAT solvers in your work. The tutorial assumes no background knowledge beyond what a new graduate student in Computer Science would possess.</p>

For the past 15 years his work has concentrated on automated reasoning algorithms for solving various forms of the satisfiability problem: finding a model (SAT), counting the number of
models (#SAT), solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), and finding optimal models (MaxSat). His group has been successful in building award winning solvers for all of these problems. He has served as the program chair of several major AI conferences, including Uncertainty in AI (UAI), the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) and the International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT); and will serve as conference chair of IJCAI-17.

Computational Epidemiology and Public Health Policy Planning</h3>
<p><b>Madhav Marathe, Naren Ramakrishnan and Anil Kumar Vullikanti</b></p>

<p>Recent epidemic outbreaks have highlighted the importance of public health policy planning, involving questions like: How can an outbreak be contained before it becomes an epidemic? What disease surveillance strategies should be implemented? These are challenging problems at the interface of different areas of computer science,
including AI, machine learning and data mining, mathematics, economics, and statistics. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of the state of the art in computational epidemiology from a multi-disciplinary perspective. The specific topics we will discuss include: (1) mathematical and computational models for epidemic spread, primarily
focusing on network based models; (2) design of interventions for epidemic control and response, which involve a broad class of multicriteria optimization and game-theoretical problems; (3) inference and state assessment for network models, and their use in forecasting epidemic dynamics. These problems are complicated by the fact that behaviors, disease dynamics, and social networks coevolve. We will discuss a suite of tools that combine diverse kinds of datasets and optimization tools.</p>
<p>The tutorial requires basic background in computer science and related fields, and hence will be accessible for most AAAI attendees.</p>

Learning and Inference in Structured Prediction Models</h3>
<p><b>Kai-Wei Chang, Gourab Kundu, Dan Roth, and Vivek Srikumar</b></p>

<p>Many prediction problems require assigning values to multiple interdependent variables. The relationships between these variables could represent a sequence, a set of clusters, or in the general case, a graph. Over past decades, structured prediction models for such problems have demonstrated success in a range of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision and computational biology. However, the high computational cost often limits both the expressive power of the models and the size of the data that can be handled. Therefore, designing efficient inference and learning algorithms for these models is a key challenge.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, beyond introducing the algorithmic approaches, we will discuss ideas that result in significant improvements both in the learning and the inference stages of structured prediction models. In particular, we will discuss the use of caching techniques to reuse computations and methods for decomposing complex structures, along with learning procedures that use these approaches to simplify the learning stage. We will also present a formulation that captures similarities between structured labels using distributed representations. Participants will learn about the recent trends in this domain, tools developed in this area, and how they can be applied to AI applications.</p>
