Cloud systems can run software on virtual machines that can be created on-demand in large data centres. These services will be provided through large-scale networks of new data centers, which in turn will connect to the data centers already established by organizations. As a user's demand for computing power increases, new virtual computers can be created and configured; as demand decreases, unused hardware resources can be made available again. </p><p>The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and technologists from academia and industry to explore the applications of artificial intelligence to the most pertinent technical challenges in data center management and cloud computing. Workshop participation will be by invitation only.</p><p>Topics of interest related to data center management and cloud computing include but are not limited to the following applications of AI methods to problems in the domain: online stochastic optimisation; machine learning and data mining; parameterised complexity and graph theory; optimal stopping theory for online decision-making; game theory and incentive compatible mechanism design; virtualisation; data governance, trust and security; energy and performance profiling, accounting; metrics, benchmarks, interfaces; principles of power management; performance, energy and other resource trade-offs, energy complexity; compiler optimization, application design; system-level optimization, cross-layer coordination; load and resource modeling, management; scheduling, run-time adaptation, feedback control; processor, network, storage, hardware components and architecture; reliability and power management; adaptive configuration and data placement strategies in storage arrays; protocol management and conversion in an SOA environment.</p><h4>Submissions</h4><p>If you would like to participate, submit either a full paper of no more than 6 pages (6,000 words); a short paper, or problem instance (at most 3 pages or 3,000 words); or a position statement (1 page). Short papers may address an important problem for further research or describe a practical problem or an interesting lesson learned. In addition, we solicit proposals for short demonstrations (at most 3 pages with demonstrations taking at most 15 minutes). All submissions should conform to AAAI's formatting guidelines, and should be <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aidc2012" rel="nofollow">submitted via EasyChair.</a></p><h4>Workshop Cochairs</h4><p>Barry O'Sullivan (4C, UCC, Ireland)<br />Donagh Buckley (EMC, Ireland)<br /><i>Contact:</i>&#97;&#105;&#100;&#99;&#50;&#48;&#49;&#50;&#64;&#101;&#97;&#115;&#121;&#99;&#104;&#97;&#105;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</p><h4>Additional Information</h4><p>For additional information, please visit the <a href="http://osullivan.ucc.ie/aaai-2012-aidc" rel="nofollow">supplemental workshop site.</a></p><div class="hr1"><hr /></div><h3><a name="ws03">W3</a> &mdash; Cognitive Robotics</h3><p>Research in robotics has traditionally emphasized low-level sensing and control tasks including sensory processing, path planning, and manipulator design and control. In contrast, research in cognitive robotics is concerned with endowing robots and software agents with higher level cognitive functions that enable them to reason, act and perceive in changing, incompletely known, and unpredictable environments. Such robots must, for example, be able to reason about goals, actions, when to perceive and what to look for, the cognitive states of other agents, time, collaborative task execution, and so on. In short, cognitive robotics is concerned with integrating reasoning, perception and action with a uniform theoretical and implementation framework.</p><p>The use of both software robots (softbots) and robotic artifacts in everyday life is on the upswing and we are seeing increasingly more examples of their use in society with commercial products around the corner and some already on the market. As interaction with humans increases, so does the demand for sophisticated robotic capabilities associated with deliberation and high-level cognitive functions. Combining results from the traditional robotics discipline with those from AI and cognitive science has and will continue to be central to research in cognitive robotics.</p><h4>Topics</h4><p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers involved in all aspects of the theory and implementation of cognitive robots, to discuss current work and future directions. While the emphasis of the workshop is on the methods and techniques developed in the field of AI, we welcome work in related cognitive science disciplines investigating computational/cognitive models of behavior. Also, we especially welcome discussions and demonstrations of implemented systems.</p><h4>Format</h4><p>We anticipate a two-day workshop that will comprise of several sessions including presentations of research papers, position papers, and posters. The workshop will also include discussion panels and a session for live system demonstrations, providing an opportunity to showcase and discuss emerging technologies.</p><h4>Attendance</h4><p>Attendance at this workshop is open to all interested in the field, as well as authors of accepted papers. Those interested to attend who have not a paper to present, are encouraged to send a brief submission of interest to the workshop chairs before the event. We expect 25&ndash;50 attendees.</p><h4>Submissions</h4><p>Potential participants are invited to submit either a full-length technical paper or a statement of interest with a position paper. Submissions are accepted in PDF format only, using the AAAI formatting guidelines. Submissions must be no longer than eight pages in length, including references and figures.

Understanding language about physical systems requires the ability to ground the language, or to extract a semantically meaningful representation from the language and map it to the external world. Language grounding has received substantial attention recently, due largely to recent advances in robotics, sensing, natural language processing, and formal representation systems. The AAAI-12 workshop on Grounding Language for Physical Systems will provide a venue to discuss shared problems, descriptions of key research problems and challenges, and make progress towards formulating shared definitions.</p><p>Topics will include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Definitions of and possible approaches to the grounding problem.</li><li>Methods and models for mapping between language and the external world.</li><li>Interactive physical systems for exploring grounding.</li><li>Knowledge representations that support a range of semantic constructions.</li><li>Algorithms for learning grounded meanings from gesture, language, and other inputs.</li><li>Interpreting instructions for physically-grounded perceptual or manipulative tasks.</li><li>Vision, haptics, audio, and other sensing modalities for grounding linguistic elements such as attributes, objects, tasks, and spatial relationships.</li><li>Challenge problems in the grounding space.</li></ul><h4>Format</h4><p>The workshop will consist of six invited talks and a poster session; discussion periods after each talk will facilitate interaction among participants. Authors of accepted papers will present at the poster session over lunch, and some authors may also be invited to give short talks. A moderated final discussion will provide an opportunity to sum up the results of the day and define next steps.</p><p>The workshop is expected to have 25-&ndash;30 researchers, split among invited participants, respondents to the call for participation, and interested researchers from relevant areas.</p><h4>Submissions</h4><p>Paper submissions should not exceed 6 pages in length, and should be in PDF format. Submissions should be formatted according to the AAAI 2012 Workshop Author Instructions (this will not be a double-blind reviewing process).

With the immense growth of the web, human computation systems can now leverage the abilities of an unprecedented number of Internet users to perform complex computation. Various genres of human computation applications are available today, including games with a purpose (for example, the ESP Game), crowdsourcing marketplaces (for example, Amazon Mechanical Turk), and identity verification systems (for example, reCAPTCHA).</p><p>Despite the variety of human computation applications, there exist many common core research issues. How can we design mechanisms for querying human computers that incentivizes truthful responses? How do we effectively assign tasks to human computers to match their particular expertise and interests? What are programming paradigms for designing algorithms that effectively leverage a crowd? How do we build human computation systems that involve the joint efforts of both machines and humans? Significant advances on such questions will likely draw on many disciplines, including machine learning, mechanism and market design, information retrieval, decision-theoretic planning, optimization, human computer interaction, and so forth.</p><p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together academic and industry researchers from diverse subfields in AI for a stimulating discussion of existing human computation applications and future directions of this relatively new subject area.</p><h4>Topics</h4><p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<ul><li>Programming languages, tools and platforms to support human computation </li><li>Domain-specific challenges in human computation</li><li>Methods for estimating the cost, reliability, and skill of labelers</li><li>Methods for designing and controlling workflows for human computation tasks</li><li>Empirical and formal models of incentives in human computation systems </li><li>Design of manipulation-resistance mechanisms in human computation </li><li>Techniques for inferring expertise and routing tasks to the appropriate individuals</li><li>Theoretical limitations of human computation</li><li>Novel human computation systems</li></ul><h4>Format</h4><p>The workshop consists of invited talks from prominent researchers, presentations of selected technical and position papers, and two poster and demo sessions.</p><h4>Submission</h4><p>Technical papers and position papers may be up to 6 pages in length.

The problem is to compute a path for each agent from an initial to a goal location without conflicting with other agents, often aiming to minimize a cost function, such as elapsed time or throughput. Applications include vehicle fleet coordination, computer games, robotics and various military scenarios.</p><p>Some researchers have worked at a theoretical level, while others have implemented solvers for specific applications. Thus, related papers have appeared in multiple venues, including AIJ, JAIR, AAAI, IJCAI, ICRA, IROS, ICAPS and SoCS. Consequently, similar concepts were developed in different sub-communities, using varying terminology.</p><p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers working on multiagent path planning from the different communities.

Yet, the assumptions of classical planning (determinism, model completeness, and others) are often criticized as being too restrictive to address "real" planning problems.</p><p>Recently many researchers have started to exploit the good performance of classical planners to solve a much wider range of problems that, although they may not appear to be "deterministic planning" problems, nevertheless fit within the classical planning model (that is, propositional description of a known state and goal, deterministic actions that modify a state). The approach typically consists of creating classical planning problems whose solution is directly or indirectly used to obtain a solution to the original problem. In this way, classical planners have been used for dealing with more expressive planning problems, including incomplete information, temporally extended goals and preferences, as well as to solve problems in bioinformatics (for example, genome rearrangement and gene regulatory networks), and active diagnosis. In some cases, modifications of the classical planner may be necessary.</p><p>This workshop welcomes submissions on the use of classical planners for solving challenging problems in AI, and in other fields. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p><p><i>Solving AI problems, including:</i> expressive planning, agent and multiagent systems, game playing, story telling, knowledge acquisition, reasoning with preferences, computational social choice, natural language and commonsense reasoning.</p><p><i>Real-world application problems</i> where creating a classical planning problem is a key step in the proposed solution.</p><h4>Submissions</h4><p>We plan to have one or two invited speakers, representing academic and industry research, as well as oral presentation of papers accepted. Workshop submissions can be technical papers (up to 6 pages) or shorter position statements, challenges, and so on. Technical papers will be reviewed by at least one researcher.

An increasing number have realized that opening access to their data, and building semantic models to abstract as well as interconnect them can unleash economic growth while addressing sustainability issues. We call cities that enable such capabilities "semantic cities."</p><p>In a semantic city, available resources are harnessed safely, sustainably and efficiently to achieve positive, measurable economic and societal outcomes. Enabling City information as a utility, through a robust (expressive, dynamic, scalable) and (critically) a sustainable technology and socially synergistic ecosystem could drive significant benefits and opportunities. Data (and then information and knowledge) from people, systems and things is the single most scalable resource available to City stakeholders to reach the objective of semantic cities.</p><p>Two major trends are supporting semantic cities - open data and semantic web. "Open data is the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control." A number of cities and government have made their data publicly available, prominent being London (UK), Chicago (USA), Washington DC (USA), and Dublin (Ireland). </p><p>Semantic web as the technology to interconnect heterogeneous data has matured and it is being increasingly used in the form of Linked Open Data and formal ontologies. Thus, a playfield for more AI research-driven technologies for cities has emerged.</p><p>In this context, the aims of the workshop are to:</p><ol><li>Draw the attention of the AI community to the research challenges and opportunities in semantic cities.</li><li>Draw the attention on the multidisciplinary dimension and its impact on semantic cities for example, transportation, energy, water management.</li><li>Identify unique issues of this domain and what new techniques may be needed. As an example, since governments and citizens are involved, data security and privacy are first-class concerns.</li><li>Promoting more cities to become semantic cities.</li><li>Elaborating a (semantic data) benchmark for testing AI techniques on semantic cities.</li><li>Provide a platform for sharing best-practices and discussion.</li></ol><p>We encourage submissions that show the relevance or application of AI technologies for computational sustainability domains. Apart from focus on foundational technologies for semantic cities (information management, knowledge management, ontology, inference model, data integration), we want to promote illustrative use-cases using the semantic cities foundation. </p><p>Examples are transportation (traffic prediction, personal travel optimization, carpool and fleet scheduling), public safety (suspicious activity detection, disaster management), healthcare (disease diagnosis and prognosis, pandemic management), water management (flood prevision, quality monitoring, fault diagnosis), food (food traceability, carbon-footprint tracking), energy (smart grid, carbon footprint tracking, electricity consumption forecasting) and buildings (energy conservation, fault detections). We also encourage submissions that address unique characteristics of standard AI enabling sustainability problems, like optimization, reasoning, planning and learning. Outside AI, we encourage submissions from communities engaged in open data and corresponding standardization efforts, to make their work available at this AI forum.</p><p>Topics of interest include, but not restricted to, are:<ol><li>Process to open city (government) data</li><li>Platforms to manage government data</li><li>Provenance, access control and privacy-preserving issues in open data</li><li>Data cities interoperability</li><li>Semantic models - especially those built collaboratively and evolving</li><li>Data integration and organization in semantic cities (social media feeds, sensor data)</li><li>Internet of things in semantic cities</li><li>Robust inference models for semantic cities</li><li>Semantic event detection and classification</li><li>Applications in semantic cities</li><li>Spatio-temporal analysis and visualization</li><li>User interaction in exploring semantic data of cities</li><li>Knowledge representation and reasoning challenges</li><li>Knowledge acquisition, evolution and maintenance</li><li>Challenges with managing and integrating real-time and historical data</li><li>Managing "big data"</li><li>Integrated systems</li><li>Applied ai models for semantic cities</li><li>Issues in scaling out ai techniques for semantic cities</li><li>Case studies, successes, lessons learnt</li><li>Public datasets and competitions</li></ol><h4>Format</h4><p>The workshop will consist of papers and poster presentations, a panel, an invited talk, and discussion sessions, in one full-day schedule. The invited talk will invite a leading expert in the field to present their research and vision of future work. The panel will focus on connecting the AI researchers to the various challenges that the targeted domain brings.</p><h4>Submissions</h4><p>All papers submissions must be in AAAI format. They can be one of two types. The first is regular research papers, which can be up to 6 pages long and are expected to present a significant contribution. The second is short submission of up to 4 pages, which describes a position on the topic of the workshop or a demonstration/ tool.
